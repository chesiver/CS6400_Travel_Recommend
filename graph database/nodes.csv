Entry is through the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and of Military History and is free. Take Metro line 1 east, exit Schuman and walk east or exit Mérode and walk west."
AV_tHz0Cbat9RzbdALoB,Belgium,Brussels,Stoclet/Stokkel House," Several turn-of-the-century houses and manors can still be seen today, such as the  Stoclet/Stokkel House , a  UNESCO World Heritage Site , which was built between 1905 and 1909 on a design by Josef Hoffmann and contains mosaics and paintings by Gustav Klimt."
AV_tHz0Cbat9RzbdALoC,Belgium,Brussels,Grand Place-Grote Markt,"Surrounded by the city tower and a range of beautiful 300 year old buildings. In the evening, surrounded by bright illumination, it is simply ravishing. Some evenings a music and light show is provided with the buildings serving as a canvas. Have a ""gaufre de Liège-Luikse wafel"" here (Belgian waffle with caramelized sugar)—the best ones are available from the little shops off the northeast corner of the Grand Place-Grote Markt."
AV_tHz0Cbat9RzbdALoD,Belgium,Brussels,Manneken Pis,"Just a short walk from the Grand Place-Grote Markt is the Manneken Pis, a small bronze statue thought to represent the ""irreverent spirit"" of Brussels. This is a statue of a child urinating into a pool. Belgians have created hundreds of outfits for this statue. There are many stories of the statue's origins. It is believed to have been inspired by a child who, while in a tree, found a special way to drive away invading troops. Another story goes that a father was missing his child and made a declaration to the city that when he found him he would build a statue of him, doing whatever it was that he was doing. It has also been said a witch turned him to stone for peeing on her property. The most likely scenario is that it was the location of the market for urine, which was used for its ammonia content to tan leathers. None are definitively true. In 1747, Louis XV's soldiers stole the statue, upsetting many of the city's residents. Louis XV made it up to the city by giving the statue a medal of honor (so that he must be saluted when French soldiers pass by} and by giving him an outfit. He now gets dressed up on special occasions."
AV_tHz0Cbat9RzbdALoE,Belgium,Brussels,Jeanneke Pis,"Jeanneke Pis is a modern fountain and statue in Brussels, which forms a counterpoint in gender terms to the city's trademark Manneken Pis at the Grand Place (Grote Markt). It was commissioned by Denis-Adrien Debouvrie in 1985 and erected in 1987 and endowed with its own instant legend, the better to amuse strollers. This half-metre-high statue of blue-grey limestone depicts a little girl with her hair in short pigtails, squatting and urinating, apparently very contentedly. It is located on the east side of the Impasse de la Fidélité / Getrouwheidsgang (Fidelity Alley), a narrow cul-de-sac some 30 metres long leading northwards off the restaurant-packed Rue des Bouchers / Beenhouwersstraat. It is unsurprisingly much less well known than its male counterpart, being a new addition instead of a centuries-old symbol of the city. The sculpture is now protected by iron bars from vandalism"
AV_tHz0Cbat9RzbdALoF,Belgium,Brussels,Atomium,"Unavoidable icon of Brussels and Belgium, important place for international tourism, unique creation in the history of architecture and emblematic vestige of the World Fair in Brussels (Expo 58) the Atomium continues to embody its ideas of the future and universality, half a century later. In its cultural programme it carries on the debate of 1958: What kind of future do we want for tomorrow? Our happiness depends on what? Its recent renovation in 2006 gave its original brightness back, and the new equipment guarantees its durability. Five of the nine spheres are open to the public (so they say, but not really true). One of them is housing a permanent exhibition dedicated to Expo 58 (just some small models of some countries pavilions). Another sphere is dedicated to temporary exhibitions with scientific themes (often closed when there is no exhibition). The upper sphere offers spectacular views of the city of Brussels. When the sky is clear, the view reaches till Antwerp. There is a ""kids zone"" sphere which staff will happily direct you to even though you can never go in, it is only open to touring schoolchildren, and there is nothing inside except places for kids to sleep. In truth there are only three spheres: the top (restaurant), middle (snack bar) and bottom; the only thing to see really is the view; rather expensive at 11 €. The restaurant, also situated at the top, is open every day till 11.00 p.m. At night, the nine spheres are lit up with 2,970 lights that offer a very special show. To enrich your visit: audioguides in EN (but also in F, NL, ES, IT and RU) are available at the cash desk for 2€. Visio-guides are also available (€2) for the deaf and hard of hearing people. In August 2010, a zip-line was available from the top of the tallest sphere (102m); the ""Death Ride"" (run by former members of the Belgian Special Services) is a separate 25€, and offers a rather unique view of the insides of the Atomium and the surrounding city."

It is located mainly in Rue d'Aerschot/ Aarschotstraat, behind the North Train Station. Contrary to The Netherlands, prostitution is NOT legal in Belgium, they exploit a loophole in the local legislation presenting brothels as ""bars"". Do not expect to actually get a drink in there though. Despite heavy police presence, it still remains a fairly seedy area, not the kind of place where you'd want to walk alone at night. "

You should particularly seek out the subsequent rooms featuring Pieter Brueghel, including his Adoration of the Magi. Don't miss his unusual Fall of the Rebel Angels, with grotesque faces and beasts. But don't fear, many of Brueghel's paintings, like those depicting Flemish village life, are of a less fiery nature. Later artists represented include Rubens, Van Dyck, Frans Hals, and Rembrandt. Next door, in a circular building connected to the main entrance, the modern art section has an emphasis on underground works - if only because the museum's eight floors are all below ground level. The collection includes works by van Gogh, Matisse, Dalí, Tanguy, Ernst, Chagall, Miró, and local boys Magritte, Delvaux, De Braekeleer and Permeke. Don't miss David's famous ""Death of Marat."""

AV_tHz0Kbat9RzbdALwB,Bangladesh,Kolkata,City of Joy," Kolkata has been nicknamed as the  City of Joy . This comes from the numerous palatial mansions built all over the city. During the British colonial era from 1700-1912, when Calcutta was the capital of British India, it witnessed a spate of frenzied construction activity of buildings largely influenced by the conscious intermingling of Gothic, Baroque, Roman, Oriental and Islamic schools of design. Unlike many north Indian cities, whose construction stresses minimalism, the layout of much of the architectural variety in Kolkata owes its origins to European styles and tastes imported by the British and, to a much lesser extent, the Portuguese and French.  The buildings were designed, and inspired by the tastes of the English gentleman around and the aspiring Bengali Babu (literally a nouveau riche Bengali who aspired to cultivation of English etiquette, manners and custom as such practices were favourable to monetary gains from the British).  Today many of these structures are in various stages of decay. Some of the major buildings of this period are well maintained and several buildings have been declared as heritage structures. Conservation efforts are patchy and are often affected by problems of litigation, tenant troubles, ownership disputes, old tenancy laws and a lack of funds."
AV_tHz0Kbat9RzbdALwC,Bangladesh,Kolkata,Government House,"  Government House , Kolkata, built in the early 19th century, is modelled on Kedleston Hall. The House was once the seat of the Viceroys of India; later, when the Government moved to New Delhi, it became the residence of the Governor of Bengal, a function that it fulfils to this day. While the basic features of Kedleston have been faithfully copied (the Palladian Front, the Dome etc.), Government House is a much larger, three storeyed structure. Also, the Government of India evidently did not have the funding constraints that forced the Curzons to leave their house incomplete: Government House has all four wings originally conceived for Kedleston. So today, a 'complete', brick built Kedleston, on a much grander scale, is in its acres of gardens at the heart of the Kolkata business district."

For example, the Inca culture had three commandments: Don't be a thief, don't be a liar, and don't be lazy. Apparently, the indigenous people would create big intricate textiles as proof that they weren't being lazy.  In the collection from the Tarabuco culture, the artists would only weave images of what they knew: people plowing the land, dancers, and horses. In addition to this you can visit Inca Pallay-Asociación de Arte Indigena.

In addition to viewing textiles at the Museum, you can also see artists hard at work using ancient techniques of weaving, washing, and spinning the wool.

Upon crossing a long bridge over the Tundzha, you will arrive on an island surrounded by two branches of the Tundzha (though not immediately recognizable as such while you are actually on it). A modern stadium in which annual wrestling competitions take place, surrounded by some statues of champions of past years will welcome you to this island. Just next to it is the  Justice Tower  ( Adalet Kasrı ), a sturdy square tower and the sole completely intact remnant of former imperial palace of Ottomans here. Next to the Tower, a smaller bridge on the narrower branch of the river surrounded by some centuries-old ash trees will take you back to the “mainland”. Here at your right, about 100 metres away, is the monument to the soldiers fallen at the Siege of Edirne in 1913 ( Monument to the Martyrs of Balkan War / Balkan Savaşı Şehitliği ). The monument itself, which is a recent construction with an older one hidden behind the bushes nearby, is nothing very interesting, typical of many such Turkish monuments built to commemorate World War I and previous battles in, say,  Gallipoli . However the site is actually mass grave of an estimated 30,000 soldiers, so appropriate respect should be shown. Further away from the river is the ruins of a number of buildings of the  former palace  scattered around the fields, which had the unfortunate service as an arsenal during the siege of 1913, and had been blown up in order not to fall in hands of Bulgarians, the opposite side of the battle. Although the place had lost the distinction of being a capital in 15th century, it was still the favourite summer retreat of Ottoman dynasty, featuring numerous hunting manors on the edges of the actual palace. Ruins are now undergoing a slow restoration (or perhaps reconstruction), with the imperial kitchen has returned to its pre-1913 appearance recently. An illustration in front of the gate of the palace building—the only part of the building that escaped the blast—may help you envisage what the palace looked like.   Free .   edit"

This museum, which was awarded “European Museum of the Year” in early 2000s, was essentially a mental institution used during Ottoman times, part of  Beyazıt Complex  ( Beyazıt Külliyesi ). It was notable for its “progressive”/”alternative” approach towards its patients. Instead of locking them into cells with shackles, which was widespread during that time, methods such as meditative music or flower gardens were tried in this institution. Today, many Ottoman miniatures from medical schoolbooks and elsewhere and models of patients are among the displayed.    edit"
AV_tHz0Pbat9RzbdAL6D,Turkey,Edirne,Selimiye Mosque," mosque which dominates the skyline of the city, built on a slightly higher hill than its surroundings, although a play on dimensions makes the exterior sight of the building smaller as you get closer to it. A grandiose piece of art by Sinan, the Ottoman architect of 16th century, Selimiye is usually considered the zenith of Ottoman architecture and has been listed as a   by UNESCO in 2011. Sinan himself considered this building as his best work. The dome of the building, which hangs high over main hall, encloses a huge space which gives the place an expansive atmosphere, had the largest diameter (31.28 mt) of all domes in the world for several centuries. And its minarets (towers) are the second highest minarets (70.89 mt) in whole world, surpassed only by Qutb Minar (72.50 mt) in  ,  . The mosque has 999 windows in total, which according to its architect Sinan, symbolize the perfectness of God. The dome and interior walls are decorated with calligraphy and geometrical designs, most of which are painted in hues of pink and blue. If you have admired   of  , you’ll sure adore this one, since Blue Mosque is quite a copy of Selimiye. The upside down tulips, which are some sort of symbol of Edirne have their origin in a tulip illustration engraved on a marble in the fountain right under the central dome of Selimiye. It is believed to symbolize the landlord of the tulip garden on which the mosque was built, who was said to be reluctant to give over his garden. There is a small museum in the courtyard with no admossion fee. Very interesting knick-knacks can be seen there."

Long undergoing restoration, interior of the mosque, which features a colourfully decorated central dome, smaller surrounding domes of varying sizes each featuring a different colour pattern, and very stately columns supporting them, has recently been re-opened to visits. The overall experience of this colourful mosque is perhaps best summarized as ""joyful""."

A round and robust tower, not unlike  's White Tower except its colour, and next to it is the last visible section of city walls, now surrounded by a nicely landscaped park. It’s possible to enter the tower itself, but impossible to climb upstairs. It’s located in a back alley, so while you are near the Üç Şerefeli, look around on the top of buildings to see the flag on a tower made of red-brick if you can’t exactly locate it. The tower also served as a clock tower until 1953, when the upper part of the tower was demolished because of the danger of collapse."

On the plus side, it makes a good picnic spot and there's a chocolate and pastry store right nearby with a service station opposite for drinks.

The Tunis medina's main routes are labeled ""touristique"", but even a few steps off the beaten track it's a real, working market.  Behind the often scruffy facades hide old palaces, mosques, Islamic schools. Compared to  Morocco  or even  Sousse  you will not be hassled here. Bab El Bahr (The large stone-arch ""French Gate"" at the head of Avenue DeFrance) is a good starting point for the Souk. The goldsmiths are close to Bab Bnet.  Haggle  if you wish to buy anything - a quarter of the price first asked is a good starting point, except for obviously cheap items. As always, if you give a price and they agree, you will be expected to pay. The tourist office adjacent to the Clock Tower has excellent maps of the medina that depict an interesting walking tour.

You can take a trolley from the subway station - 2 stops - or have a pleasant 15 minute walk. ).  One of the oldest and most important monasteries in Ukraine and in the territory of the former Soviet Union. Only the most important monasteries were designated as Lavras; there were only four, of which this Cave Monastery is the oldest. It was founded in 1077 by St Antoniy. The caves were dug out by priests who lived there as hermits. Nowadays, the caves are venerated by the faithful and tourists who visit the mummified monks, and pilgrims are still allowed access to the underground church there. There are two parts to the modern complex: the upper lavra, owned by the state and consisting of a number of museums (entry fee, most of them work until 18h); and the lower lavra, owned by the Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriach) and consisting of the caves (you'll need 1 UAH to buy a candle to enter). Entry is 40UAH. Do not miss the display of micro-miniatures in the upper lavra (40UAH). It sounds lame, but it is fascinating. You can enter the caves in the lower part if you dress correctly (women MUST cover their hair and wear skirts, no shorts. Expensive scarves are for sale there). Women can only just get away with pants in the winter.  Start at the Lower Lavra, visiting the caves before the crowds descend for the day (open till 16h anyway). There are two cave complexes, each housing the mummified remains of monks, as well as religous icons and other relics. Both caves are accessed through churches, with the entrance to the shorter caves at the end of a boardwalk. While it is free to enter the caves, you must purchase a taper candle for 3UAH in order to light your way. The caves are not recommended for the claustrophobic or overly tall. Once you're in there, it's hard, even impossible to turn around and go back out - you have to keep going. Some parts of the tunnels are open only to pilgrims, not tourists; sometimes these are guarded by priests but sometimes anyone can walk through. Pay 40UAH extra to visit the newly refurbished bell tower for superb 360 degree views of Kyiv. On the walk back to the Metro, stop by the very distinctive  Holodomor Memorial  and underground exhibit in the park. An entrance fee of 15UAH gets you entry; there is an English lanuage video and some computerised exhibits in English    edit"

His scientific and astronomical discoveries greatly advanced knowledge in these fields. The monument is situated in the north-east outskirts of city at the foot Chupan-ata mountain, which in medieval times was called Kukhak. That was three floor round building, decorated by glazed tiles, majolica, mosaic, but it was destroyed. The only thing that was preserved is a part of huge sextant – major astronomic instrument, the lowest part of which was in a deep trench (11km). Both arcs of this instrument are made of marble with indication of degrees. During the excavation works there were found a lot of remains of other astronomic instruments. Even being preserved partially, the observatory of Ulugbek is unique not only for Central Asia, but also for the whole world. The remains of observatory were conserved at the beginning of 60s XX.

AV_tHz0Sbat9RzbdAMAN,Uzbekistan,Shakhrisabz,Ak Saray Palace,"Ak Saray means ""white palace"". The term ""ak"" has also the meaning ""generous"", ""aristocratic"" or ""majestic"". Temur'S chronicler   reported that the world has not seen a similar building before the point of which extends from earth to the height of heaven. The palace was founded in the hours predicted by astrology. Its construction was begun in 1380 after Temur's conquest of Konye Urgench in Khorezm. Artisans from Khorezm were brought here to work on the palace and create its rich decoration. In 1396 the construction works were almost completed. The Spanish ambassador Clavigo reports that the decoration works still continued in 1404. The dimensions of the building can be perceived when looking at the gate towers: the two towers were 50 m high and had an arch with a span of 22 m. The buildings were destroyed in the 16th cent. by order of the ruler of Bukhara,  . The legend tells that Abdullah Khan was riding to Shahrizabs and saw the palace at a distance. He sent a messenger to the city as he thought that he was already near of it. The messengers nearly died of exhaustion, but the palace was still far away. The khan got angry and ordered the palace to be destoyed. The architecture of the palace is similar to Khoja Ahmed Yasavi Mausoleum in Turkestan/Kazakhstan which was built on the orders of Temur. Archaeological excavations south of Ak Saray have revealed the rich decorated cover of the floor and rich architectural decoration consisting of majolica, marble and combination of terracotta and ornamental mosaic. Only the piles of the portals are left from Ak-Saray. The piles originally were round towers with spiral stairs inbside. Today, the towers are 38 m high. Originally, they reached a height of 50 m. The size of the palace is impressive: the main courtyard was about 120 m wide and 240 m long. Calculations from the proportions of the surviving elements let us assume that the length of the main portal was 70 m and that the towers at the corners were more than 80 m high. The 22 m wide span of the arch of the main entrance was the largest in Central Asia. The mosaic and majolica work in the niche of the portal is particularly refined. The delicate foliage ornamentation also contains calligraphic inscriptions of verses from the Quran as well as a few secular inscriptions. In the middle of the decoration an inscription gives the date of the completion 798 (1395/1396) and the name of the craftsman   from Tabriz/Persia. The legend tells that the architect after Temur had explained his plans started to make foundations blocks from clay mixed with gold. When Temur asked why he did that, the architect answered that he wanted to be sure that Temur was determined to construct a building that required vast expenditures. "

There are two parts to the modern complex: the upper lavra, owned by the state and consisting of a number of museums (entry fee, most of them work until 18h); and the lower lavra, owned by the Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriach) and consisting of the caves (you'll need 1 UAH to buy a candle to enter). Entry is 40UAH. Do not miss the display of micro-miniatures in the upper lavra (40UAH). It sounds lame, but it is fascinating. You can enter the caves in the lower part if you dress correctly (women MUST cover their hair and wear skirts, no shorts. Expensive scarves are for sale there). Women can only just get away with pants in the winter.  Start at the Lower Lavra, visiting the caves before the crowds descend for the day (open till 16h anyway). There are two cave complexes, each housing the mummified remains of monks, as well as religous icons and other relics. Both caves are accessed through churches, with the entrance to the shorter caves at the end of a boardwalk. While it is free to enter the caves, you must purchase a taper candle for 3UAH in order to light your way. The caves are not recommended for the claustrophobic or overly tall. Once you're in there, it's hard, even impossible to turn around and go back out - you have to keep going. Some parts of the tunnels are open only to pilgrims, not tourists; sometimes these are guarded by priests but sometimes anyone can walk through. Pay 40UAH extra to visit the newly refurbished bell tower for superb 360 degree views of Kyiv. On the walk back to the Metro, stop by the very distinctive   and underground exhibit in the park. An entrance fee of 15UAH gets you entry; there is an English lanuage video and some computerised exhibits in English"

For International league matches(e.g. Champions League) against European opponents tickets will obviously be in more demand.

Originally, the mausoleum was intended for the grave of Ismail Samani’s father,  , but later became the burial vault of the Samanids. It was completed in 905 and is the oldest Muslim monument in Bukhara. It is considered as a masterpiece of early Islamic architecture.    was born in 234/849 and died in 295/907. He was the first member of the Samanid dynasty ruling over all Transoxania and Fargana. He was governor of Bukhara on behalf of his brother  . Ismail had defend Bukhara against attacks by Khwarazmian forces. He twice failed to send the 500,000 dirhams annual tribute to Nasr and had to defend the city against two attacks by Nasr. After Nasr's death in 279/892 Ismail became ruler of all Transoxania. He transfered the capital to Bukhara and was recognized as governor by caliph   (279-89/892-902). In 280/893 he led an expedition north into the steppes, capturing Ṭaraz (modern Dzhambul/Kazakhstan), taking an immense booty of animals and Turkish slaves, and converting a Nestorian Christian church into a mosque. Ismail's greatest achievement was the defeat of   in a battle near Balk in 287/900. Amr had received from caliph al-Moʿtażed eastern Persia and Transoxania, which entailed deposing Ismail as governor. Amr invaded the upper Oxus (Amu Darya) provinces, but was decisively defeated by Esmaʿīl. The ʿAbbasids at Baghdad were thus relieved of pressure from the aggressive Saffarids, and the caliph formally appointed Ismail governor of Khorasan, Sistan, Ray, Ṭabarestan, and Isfahan, in addition to his Transoxanian provinces. Samanid amirs were, however, able to retain permanent control of Khorasan and Transoxania only. Although he still officially recognized the caliphs’ overlordship in the Friday sermon and on his coins), Ismail took advantage of his distance from Iraq and his new prestige to function as an independent sovereign. There is no evidence that he ever forwarded regular tribute or taxation to Baghdad. He spent his last years witgh battles against the Zaydi Shiite imams in the Caspian provinces, extending Samanid power westward across northern Persia, and repelling a Turkish invasion from the steppes. Ismail launched an offensive against Ṭabarestan and northern Persia and by 287/900 held territory as far west as Ray and Qazvin, though again his successors were not able to hold on to these areas. When Ismail died he was succeeded by his son Ahmad (295-301/907-14). Ismalil became renowned for justice and piety and for serving the caliph and his interests faithfully and is considered as the greatest of the Samanids. "

The whole region is fairly sandy, with orange sand threatening to blow onto the coastal road in some spots. The  red sand dunes  that visitors visit are about 50ha (1/2km²) of open sand on a hillside with ten-meter undulations, staffed by dusty children with plastic slides who will offer instruction and assistance if you want to slide on the sand. Be careful of these children as they will offer to carry your bag for you as you go sliding, then steal your phone or wallet. There are so many boys that you won't be able to tell who did it. The dunes also offer nice views of the coast to the north. In all, it's worth a half-hour visit, especially if you have rented your own motorbike for the day. On the opposite side of the road are a series of small cafes where you can park your motorbike for a small fee if you ride there on your own. Most day tours sold by local tour operators include a stop at the dunes. A number of Mui Ne resorts are within walking distance of the red dunes (Sand Dunes Resort, Pandanus Resort, Nam Chau Resort, Malibu Resort and Blue Shell Resort).

Walking along the beach, you'll pass by fishermen sorting out their catch, ship-wharfs and, at the southern end of town, a section where claims have been stripped of their shells for many years, so the sand on the beach is now substituted with littered shells."
AV_tHz0Tbat9RzbdAMDl,Vietnam,Mui Ne,Fairy Stream," The  Fairy Stream  ( Suoi Tien ) is a little river that winds its way through bamboo forests, boulders and the dunes, in parts resembling a miniature version of the Grand Canyon. Local kids will want to accompany you to show you the way (and of course earn a dollar or so), but since you're just following the stream, there's little need. For the most part, the stream is about ankle-deep and no more than knee-deep even at its deepest. It is sandy with few stones and can be walked comfortably barefooted. You can climb up the red sand hills overlooking the river valley and even walk there parallel to the river, however, the sand may be hot on a sunny day, so bring some footwear. Walking upstream for about 20 minutes, you will reach a small waterfall into at most waist-deep water, great to take a refreshing bath before heading back! To reach the stream from Ham Tien market, pass the intersection of the road heading up to the four lanes divided highway. At this point, the name of the road changes from Nguyen Dinh Chieu to Huynh Thuc Khang. Continue east until you cross a small bridge. Coming from Mui Ne, the bridge is about two kilometers west of the town. The stream is underneath, you will see a sign pointing towards a path to the left, go that way to reach an easy place to enter the stream. If the boys at the entrance asking for payment, do not pay; all beaches and rivers are free to access in Vietnam."

AV_tHz0Tbat9RzbdAMDv,Vietnam,Hanoi,Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum,"The city down south may have his name, but only Hanoi has the man himself, entombed in distinctly   fashion - against his wishes, but that's how it goes.

Purses are allowed into the tomb, but expect them to be searched by several bored soldiers along the way. Water bottles not allowed. Left luggage is handled in a complicated scheme: there is an office near the street for large bags, with separate windows for Vietnamese and foreigners, and a further office for cameras, which will be transported to a   office right outside the exit of the mausoleum. Items checked in at the first office, however, will stay there. Note that small digital cameras can be taken into the mausoleum despite their use not being permitted inside. Note also that the mausoleum is closed for a couple months around the end of the year, when the body is taken abroad for maintenance. "
AV_tHz0Tbat9RzbdAMDw,Vietnam,Hanoi,Ho Chi Minh Museum,"This gleaming white museum and its gloriously ham-handed iconography are the perfect chaser to the solemnity of the mausoleum. The building, completed in 1990, is intended to evoke a white lotus. Some photos and old letters are on display on the second floor, but the main exhibition space is on the third floor. It includes cars crashing through walls to represent the chaos of post-war American capitalism, soldiers charging around with electric plugs, a cave hideout re-imagined as the inside of Ho Chi Minh's brain, and several other post-modern confections integrated with the main story of the man's life and his country's struggle. One of the more informative museums in Vietnam, albeit with a high dose of personality cult and political propaganda. Guides are available in English, French, Chinese and Russian, but don't bother; the displays are labelled in English and French, and it's hard to imagine the guides doing much other than belabouring the point."
AV_tHz0Tbat9RzbdAMDx,Vietnam,Hanoi,Ho Chi Minh's Vestige In The Presidential Palace Area,"The exit from the mausoleum takes you right into the grounds of the, uh, vestige, where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked from 1954 until his death in 1969. The nicely landscaped complex includes two of Ho Chi Minh's houses, kept shiny and ""as he left them"" by the authorities, as well as a garage with two of Ho's ""used cars"" and a carp-filled pond. The Presidential Palace is also nearby, but it's not always open to visitors. Pamphlets are available in English, Chinese, French, and Korean. Guided tours are usually available if you wait. Paying is not enforced unless you are one of the unlucky few to be outed from the crowd."

It is an interesting museum at any rate, with pieces such as the wonderful pictures of soldiers on boats depicted on prehistoric bronze drums, Buddhist art, and revolutionary art of the 20th century wars. Also some interesting silk paintings."
AV_tHz0Tbat9RzbdAMD0,Vietnam,Hanoi,Army Museum - Bảo Tàng Quân Đội,"Vietnam's military history extends back some two millennia, and this museum covers it on four buildings with interesting pieces. Item descriptions on museum exhibits are in Vietnamese, French and English.

AV_tHz0Tbat9RzbdAMD1,Vietnam,Hanoi,Air Force Museum - Bảo Tàng Không Quân,"There's a decent outdoor collection of a UH-1 helicopter, Soviet-built MiG fighters, a huge Mi-6 helicopter, and other aircraft; unfortunately they've been exposed to the elements for some time and local kids climb over them."

It is housed in a colonial French building which was completed in 1932. The building, designed by the architect Ernest Hébrard is considered as a successful blend between the colonial French architecture and traditional Vietnamese architecture, called Indochina architecture. He created double-walls and balconies for a natural ventilation system and protection from sunshine."

AV_tHz0Tbat9RzbdAMD7,Vietnam,Da Nang,Cham Museum,"  Cham Museum  ( Bảo Tàng Chăm ),  Trung Nu Vuong and Bach Dang Sts. Founded in 1915 by the École Française d'Extrême Orient, it houses a collection of stone sculptures from the Hindu-practicing Cham civilization, which occupied much of central Vietnam in the first millennium AD through about the 14th century.  Entrance is 30,000VND, and the museum can be toured in about an hour.  The sculptures are nearly all made of sandstone, and some have weathered badly over the centuries, but you can still appreciate the delightful artistic quality of the figures, which include Shiva, garudas, nagas, lions, monkeys, and elephants.  The collection also includes striking examples of the ancient Hindu icons of fertility -- lingam altars decorated around the sides with rows of breasts.  The sculptures were mostly removed from the facades or interiors of Cham ruins (which would have been looted otherwise.) The ruins themselves, such as nearby My Son, now tend to be crumbling piles of bricks and somewhat disappointing, giving little sense of the spectacular artwork produced by the Cham civilization.  Any visit to My Son should be paired with the Cham Museum.  The collection is also interesting to compare with Balinese sculpture and the early, Hindu phase of Angkor Wat in Cambodia."

AV_tHz0Ubat9RzbdAMD_,Vietnam,Hoi An,Museum of Trade Ceramics,"  Museum of Trade Ceramics , 80 Tran Phu Street.

As above, a younger member of the family will provide a cup of tea and a ""tour"" that doesn't stray from the front room of the house, as you'd need to step over sleeping members of the older generation to go anywhere else. The design of the house shows how local architecture incorporated Japanese and Chinese influences. Japanese elements include the crab shell-shaped ceiling supported by three beams in the living room. Chinese poems written in mother-of-pearl are hanging from a number of the columns that hold up the roof."
AV_tHz0Ubat9RzbdAMEE,Vietnam,Hoi An,Cantonese Assembly Hall,"  Cantonese Assembly Hall  ( Quang Dong ), 176 Tran Phu Street. Built in 1885, it has a calm courtyard with ornate statuary. Take a peek at the half-hidden back yard and its kitschy pastel dragon statues."

Later, while boating on the lake, he encountered a giant turtle, which grabbed the sword and carried it down to its depths, returning it to the gods from whom it had come.

AV_tHz0Ubat9RzbdAMEO,Vietnam,Hanoi,Ly Thai To Statue & Park,"The park faces Hoan Kiem lake with a beautiful view of the busy Hang Bai street and the serenity of the willows on the bank of the lake. Once known as Chi Linh Garden, then Indira Gandhi Park, many Hanoians view this mini-park as their favourite place because it is a symbol of the integration of modernity and tradition. One would surely encounter a group of youths who is practising hip-hop and break dance while at the same time, meeting a three-generation family enjoying a walk in the park."
AV_tHz0Ubat9RzbdAMEP,Vietnam,Hanoi,Hoa Lo Prison (The Hanoi Hilton),"This prison was built by the French at the turn of the 20th century, in classical French prison design. This is where the French imprisoned and executed many of the Vietnamese revolutionaries. Now a museum (2/3 of the prison was torn down to make way for the Hanoi Towers), the museum exhibits the brutal French colonial regime and the struggle of the Vietnamese people against imperialism in chilling details. The prison was also known as the ""Hanoi Hilton"" during the Vietnam War as it held American POW's shot down. Little emphasis is given to this period however, and the exhibits shown can be frustratingly skewed in propaganda, choosing to show solely regime sanctioned photos of prisoners being treated well and playing basketball, playing chess, and other staged events. They also claim to have John McCain's flight suit from when his plane was shot down."
AV_tHz0Ubat9RzbdAMEQ,Vietnam,Hanoi,B-52 Lake - Huu Tiep Lake,"Until 19 December 1972, this was just a small brackish pond just off Hoang Hoa Tham Street, about 1km west of the mausoleum. On that day, in a twisted retelling of the Hoan Kiem legend (see above), Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns took the eight-engined, 100-ton plane and sent it to the shallow bottom of the lake, where it remains today. There are more interesting things to see at your local junkyard."

In other words, despite being mountains, they are within the city limits and very accessible (15-30 minutes from your hotel depending on your location). The group includes Kim Son (Mountain of Metal), Moc Son (Mountain of Wood), Thuy Son (Mountain of Water), Hoa Son (Mountain of Fire), and Tho Son (Mountain of Earth). Several Buddhist temples have been built into the caves and grottoes, and it's a popular pilgrimage site. The real fun, though, is at the  Am Phu  cave, where you can make the steep climb up toward the light and a view from the top of the mountain, surrounded by approving sacred images...or head in the opposite direction, physically and spiritually, down to the crude Hieronymous Bosch-esque statues of sinners getting their due in the caverns below, with appropriately eerie lighting. Either way, bring walking or climbing shoes. Please note that exploring all five mountains might be ambitious for a single day's touring and would probably require quite a few hours. For those who would rather just visit one because of limitations on time or energy, go to Thuy Son which is the largest of all of the mountains with the most features to explore (including the aforementioned Am Phu cave).  Open-tour buses will stop here, but you'll be rushed along; any moto driver in Da Nang or  Hoi An  will be happy to take you and let you set the schedule. Guides are available. "

Ba Na was formerly a 1920's French resort and once boasted 200 villas, restaurants, and clubs. It is well known as the second Da Lat or Sa Pa in central Vietnam. Its temperate climate, unspoiled forest, and spectacular views over the South China Sea and the Lao mountain range made Ba Na a popular retreat for both the French and the wealthy Vietnamese. Today the area still attracts locals and tourists alike thanks to a new cable system that was officially opened on 25th March 2009 and set two Guinness World Records for its height and length. You need to get a taxi to Suoi Mo station (25$ one-way from Danang) then pay 650.000 VND per adult (250.000 VND for children between 1m and 1,3m tall, free admission for children under 1m tall) for the ticket to the cable car and the Fantasy Park which is still under construction.

A supermarket specializing in imported food items is located in the basement. (See also the ""shopping"" section for more on the mall).

AV_tHz0bbat9RzbdAMU_,South Korea,Busan,Seokbulsa Temple,"Nearest station is Mandeok station, line 3, exit 2. However, you still have a long way to go. Taking taxi to the west end of the GuMandeok tunnel might be the best idea. Mandeokgogae road starts from there. Once you get there, it's a 30 minute hike from the parking area where there are toilets and restaurants. No entry fee, horrible smelly toilet, water available. Google maps and I-maps don’t work well here. This fine but quite modern temple is not much rated by the locals, but esteemed by foreigners - possibly because it's so different from most Korean temples.  Behind the conventional front temple is a large recess in the hill side from which a second temple has been created. It has fine stone carvings, figures in niches, a superb view over Busan. There's a non Buddhist shrine to a venerable bearded personage with a tiger by his side. Even pray, if inclined; it can do no harm. The (steep) walk up is through peaceful woods."

On forefront, at top of the house you will see a statue of a guy with a hat thanking/begging for alms. The story says the career beggar who had no other income had over years used generosity of rich Košice dwellers to build the house at what was then a very 'high-end' medieval (a.k.a. Hlavna Street) part of Košice. This kind of largess may seem to be perceived a bit strange by today's beggars rarely appreciating Košice inhabitants, but it still makes up for a good narrative. And a historic house."

Due to developing infrastructure, this stream has been landed up in 1899 and was renewed only symbolically during the renovation of the main street in the 1990s.

Highlights include a   cloth that once covered the Qaaba in Mecca.  Half the time, though, it feels more like a propaganda exercise than a museum: the display on plate tectonics starts with a quote from the Quran, the history of the Sauds is rather airbrushed, and the display on the birth of Mohammed, reached from the clash and noise of the   (age of ignorance) by riding an escalator up into a room of soothing, pastel light while a choir of angels sings, has probably inspired a few conversions to Islam.  : Many cabbies will not recognize the English name, ask for the neighboring Murabba Palace ( ) instead."

AV_tHz0dbat9RzbdAMaS,Romania,Iaşi,Rich Gypsy Houses,"  Rich Gypsy Houses  The term rich gypsy may seem an oxymoron, and perhaps for this reason the few opulent gypsy mansions are worth seeking out. Unfortunately, they are not on maps. However, there are several on a street going from the main train station towards the smaller train station (Nicolina). There is a street which follows the railroad tracks very closely. Walk on this street, and you will see at least one such house. Gypsy houses are striking in contrast with Romanian houses. They are covered in sparkly, glittery materials. Their walls might be completely covered in metal, and have metal decorations which have questionable aesthetic but much cultural value. If you see a shiny metal house, it's a gypsy house. "

The Releu is a  popular picnic spot , and offers a gorgeous view of the city. It is in a strange area, which is half village half French Riviera; This means that peasants, cows, chickens and dogs still live here, but that some of the properties are being bought by rich Europeans and converted into villas. The two ways to get to the Releu are by maxi-taxi and by taxi. The taxi or maxi-taxi will leave you at the edge of the street, and you'll probably feel like you're in full blown countryside. Look for the giant antenna, and go to its base. You'll have to walk on dirt roads, but it's pretty. From the antenna, look around, and you should be able to find a crevasse (it's really rather large, like a semicircular cut in the hillside). You can see some caverns dug into the side of the hill. Go down into the semicircular cut (it's an easy walk) and go up to the wall. You can see many shells and remains of a calcarous ancient sea bed which used to cover the entire area. If you're adventurous, you can find caves in the area, some of which are quite large. There are ancient legends that tell of the locals running away from invaders in these caves and sheltering their riches. Most of the locals believe the caves to be fictitious, but they do really exist."

AV_tHz0dbat9RzbdAMaY,Romania,Iaşi,Explore Abandoned Communist Factories,"  Explore Abandoned Communist Factories  - Iasi was a burgeoning industrial center of the communist era. The communist ideal revolved around self sufficiency, so everything (except for oil and the like) that needed to be used in Iasi was made in Iasi. The city's outskirts are dominated by an immense industrial zone, in which more than 90 percent of the factories have become abandoned. When the communist regime fell, these factories closed one by one, succumbing to foreign competition and internal political chaos. What is left are hundreds of factories, buildings, warehouses and fields which are completely abandoned, overrun with shrubbery, begging for exploration.  It is unique, amazing and wild, and will not last long. With the European Union's accelerating economic involvement in Romania and the increasing price of land in the city, the industrial wasteland will soon be cleaned up and taken under control by the overzealous and bored Romanian policemen. You can get there by asking which way is the ""zona industriala"". If you are in ""Podu Ros"" walk towards ""Tesatura"" , away from downtown. As you walk you will pass the electrical power plant. You can also take tram number 1 from Podu Ros and get off at the very end (make sure it's NOT going towards Copou). At the end of the tram line, walk around, because you have entered the largest communist wasteland around Iasi. There are other abandoned factories, but this is the largest concentration. Another extremely large abandoned factory is C.U.G., and used to produce large industrial equipment. It is at the end of bus lines 9 and 41, next to ""Frumoasa"". If you take the train to come into Iasi, you'll probably go by this factory for a very long time. C.U.G. is not completely abandoned, so you should be careful, but it also probably has the most impressive warehouses and heavy machinery. Try to imagine how 30 years ago these places were the workplaces of most of the inhabitants of Iasi. Many people moved from the countryside to the city to work in these factories. "

The pool has been relocated as a big real estate project called Palas started to be built in the area. Some people also swim in the Ciric and Venetia lakes and river which lie north of the city. These are lakes, not swimming pools; there is no lifeguard, but there also are no rules. Check the bottom depth before taking a plunge. Also, the water is full of strange microorganisms and who knows what else...the local kids seem to be all right, but two-headed fish have been seen in the Ciric lake more than once.

AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMb4,Russia,Moscow,Old Arbat Street,"  Old Arbat Street   – Walk down this kitschy street and don't forget to look at the small by-streets around the Arbat.

AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMbd,Russia,Moscow,New Arbat Street,"  New Arbat Street   – Located near Old Arbat Street, this street offers a contrast from the touristy pedestrian-only thoroughfare. New Arbat is perhaps where Moscow's rich are the most visible, as some of Moscow's most expensive restaurants and nightclubs are located here.  There are some reasonably priced cafes, however. The street is lavishly lit up at night and is always very lively. Also, check out Dom Knigi (House of Books) on New Arbat.

Most of the street's architecture doesn't actually have much history to it, though along the way you will find Russia's first, and the world's busiest, McDonalds. The statue of Pushkin at Pushkinskaya Square is a very popular meeting point. Walk its length. From Red Square to Belorusski Train Station is about one hour and is a great way to see the most famous street in Moscow.

AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMbf,Russia,Saint Petersburg,Kunstkamera,"This museum is primarily famous for its one-room freak show collection of 300 year-old deformed fetuses in formaldehyde (of which you are not allowed to take pictures). The rest of the museum consists of trinkets from various world cultures (over one million exhibits). It's of interest mainly as it is the oldest state museum in Russia, established by Peter the Great in 1704—consequently it has a very dated feel."
AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMbg,Russia,Saint Petersburg,Menshikov Palace,"Operated by the Hermitage, this museum displays some art and an exhibition on life in the early 18th century, in a palace built for the first governor of St. Petersburg, and before him Peter the Great.

AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMbl,Russia,Saint Petersburg,Rostral Columns,"The first monuments you'll immediately notice on the Strelka, the Rostral Columns are yet another symbol of the city. Constructed in 1810, the columns are each adorned with six   (traditionally, the prows of captured ships), symbolizing the might of the Russian Baltic Fleet. At the base of the columns you'll see sculptures representing the great rivers of European Russia, the Volga, Dnieper, Neva, and Volkhov.

AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMbo,Russia,Saint Petersburg,Research Museum of the Academy of the Arts,"A huge collection of drawings, prints, paintings of both Russian and Western artists, as well as casts and sculptures, all on display across three floors of the Academy. The models of great Petersburg architecture, of the Smolny Monastery, St Isaac's Cathedral, Mikhailovsky Castle, etc., are especially worth seeking out."
AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMbp,Russia,Saint Petersburg,Theban Sphinxes,"You wouldn't expect it, but these two granite sphinxes are three thousand years older than the city itself! They were excavated in 1820 in the temple of Amenhotep III near  . Upon seeing them, the Russian writer and diplomat Muravyev wrote to the Tsar, and convinced him to purchase the statues for display in Petersburg. They were installed in 1834. Oddly enough, sphinxes seem to be popular in the city - there are another six made by Russian sculptors lurking about."
AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMbq,Russia,Saint Petersburg,The Twelve Colleges,"One of Domeniko Trezini's many neoclassical buildings in Petersburg, built in 1742. The ensemble is comprised of twelve identical, connected, three-story buildings. The main facade faces Mendeleevskaya St, rather than the Neva, because at the time of construction, there was a canal in place of the street, across from which was the main market on the island. Today the ensemble houses the Geological and Agricultural departments, as well as Admissions."
AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMbr,Russia,Saint Petersburg,Zoological Museum,"A wild lesson in taxidermy, the museum contains over 17 million species, stuffed, mounted, and fossilized (although due to constraints of finitude, the building ""only"" displays some 500 thousand). The collection began at the Kunstkammer, and grew into its enormous state under the later Imperial period. You won't have to look hard, but look for the complete blue whale skeleton, as well as the world's only stuffed mammoth."
AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMbs,Russia,Saint Petersburg,Church of the Holy Trinity,"Old Russian prince had a farm... And he wanted his village to have a church. He decided that it would resemble two Russian Easter dishes - kulich and paskha. The idea made the church outstanding before it was built. Then the prince found the architect who would bake the dishes. The Easter table is laid just across from Proletarskaya metro station. The church is round and yellow like a well-baked pie. It departs from the tradition (most Russian orthodox churches are cross-shaped). The bell tower isn't a tower at all. It's a pyramid plated with metal. The church is well-lit. The architect used windows and walls to direct sunbeams and then let them play inside. On clear days icons, candlesticks and chandeliers seem to be floating in the air! Ironically, along with the church, wherefrom people send messages to God, the architect built the Main post office of St. Petersburg, wherefrom people send messages to each other. The latter made him famous. The ways of God are inscrutable!"
AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMbt,Russia,Moscow,Vorobyovy Gory,"  Vorobyovy Gory  – The best place for a view of Moscow from the ground.

AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMb5,Russia,Saint Petersburg,Politechnical University Church of the Intercession,"Technical university. What can sound more secular? The church breaks the stereotype. It was drawn by the teacher who taught drawing in the university. Initially, the church was to be a part of the library. The scientists even invented an   (long before it turned into a metaphor) to split the altar from the reading room. Then it was decided to attach the church to the university hostel as a separate building. God and students became neighbours. The church mishappened to be opened on the brink of World War I and everything which followed it. That's why it was frescoed only in the mid-'90s. But it saved the church from being ordinary. It's a rarest place where one can see the Last Judgement Scene frescoed in modern times. God is painted as a large and mighty hand. The Scales of Justice are weighing human souls. The sinners are being dragged to hell by the demons. In hell they are turning into the silhouettes. But some of them are being pardoned. God's mercy is painted as the spring which is cooling hell. Four kingdoms Babylon, Macedonia, Persia and Rome are painted as a square above hell to make visitors google, why. In the corridor God is painted neither as God the Father, nor as God the Son but as the Dove (God the Holy Spirit). It's also a rarest case in Russia! "

AV_tHz0ebat9RzbdAMcu,Peru,Iquitos,Visitors beware:,"  Visitors beware:  There are several so-called 'serpentarios' in and around Iquitos, most notably two called 'Las Boas'. Even though these places claim to be 'animal rescue centers', they are illegal operations, where animals are exploited for monetary gain. Tourists are charged inflated entry rates of up to 40 soles per person, to see some animals that are often malnourished and sick, and kept under horrible conditions. As these places pay handsome kick-backs to boat owners who bring them tourists, it occurs regularly that tourists who hire a boat to take them to Pilpintuwasi, Monkey Island, or the Caiman Farm, are actually dropped off at one of the serpentarios. Don't be fooled, ripped off and cheated out of a visit to one of the better places; and don't support crime against nature with your money. Make sure you avoid the serpentarios."

It is used today for royal galas, as a banqueting hall for the city council, and other public events. The roof is reconstructed after a blast during World War II. The nearby Rosenkrantz tower has the same appearance as it had in the 16th century. The oldest part of the tower dates back to the 1270s, a few decades after Håkonshallen. It was expanded in the 1560s by the governor, Erik Rosenkrantz, to its present shape. The rest of the medieval buildings in the fortress have been replaced or demolished over the centuries, with some ruins still visible.

Also some weird and wonderful bizarre grafted trees - the roots hang down like fingers and toes where one tree has been grafted onto another, sometimes completely different, species. And there's something quite eerie about seeing plants or huge trees from completely different climates growing next to each other in apparent harmony. A great place to take a picnic - this green oasis is completely surrounded by city but even the city sounds filter out."

AV_tHz0hbat9RzbdAMpT,Niger,Maradi,The Grand Marché,"  The Grand Marché  (Big Market) occupies a two-block area in the center of town; it's a walled-off area studded with gates, so you might not recognize it from the street. Unlike most markets, there is life at here every day of the week, but to really see the orchestrated chaos as the commerce spills out into the surrounding area in all its glory, you should go during the market days, Monday and Friday. The chief attraction of the market is probably the spectacle of the thing; it's the place the locals go to do their shopping, so you won't see much that you would want to buy (though you'll encounter lots of people who would be delighted to sell it to you). One good exception is a corner with a few merchants who sell traditional charms and magic remedies(ask somebody for  magani  or  medicament traditionel ); you can get several types of magic charms and traditional jewelry from them, not to mention miles and miles of beads. These are typically extremely cheap and are a great chance to practice your bargaining skills without being out a ton of money, although many of the merchants don't speak French. While you're there, also take a moment to note the collections of traditional medicines and remedies. If you're planning on brushing up on your sorcery, you can find among the piles of herbs and plants things like hedgehog quills, chameleon tails, and even dried monkey heads. They might make fantastic gag gifts, but be forewarned that they are more expensive than you'd guess and that you can legally bring almost none of it back into the US or most European countries. "
AV_tHz0hbat9RzbdAMpU,Niger,Maradi,Palace,"  Palace .  The traditional chief for the city of Maradi lives in an impressive palace on a huge plaza on the west side of the city. The palace is visually striking from the outside. The chief's palace is actually his family's private home and the place where he holds court, so it isn't explicitly open to tourists. However, rumor has it that he likes meeting foreigners, so you might be able to charm your way in to watch him hold court, or for a tour or a private audience. A gift (money, or a more traditional gift like kola nuts) might grease the wheels. Even if you get in, expect to be shown to a comfortable chair and be kept waiting for some time (this is likely even if you make an appointment); you should seriously consider finding somebody to give you a primer on the etiquette for encountering a Hausa traditional chief before you try to go. "
AV_tHz0hbat9RzbdAMpV,Niger,Maradi,The Artisan's Center,"  The Artisan's Center  is in the north of the city, and is the workplace for a friendly collection of mostly Tuareg blacksmiths, jewelers, and leatherworkers, as well as a store that sells their wares. The selection at the store is less diverse than what is found elsewhere, perhaps because Maradi is neither a Tuareg city nor a place frequented by tourists, but the prices are more reasonable (although the arrangement where every artisan's wares are sold in the same store makes the prices far less negotiable than it might be elsewhere). The prices are certainly more reasonable than they are at the Guest House, the only other place in Maradi that the author is aware of where you can reliably buy pieces of world-famous Tuareg silver jewelry. If you're going to go, though, don't just go to buy stuff. Take the time to go around and watch the artisans working; a lot of their work is fascinating to watch, and they are a very friendly, talkative bunch. If you are invited in for tea, feel free to accept or decline; if you accept, be aware that you will be signing up for one of the strongest caffeine kicks you can get and that it is considered rude to leave before you've had three cups. While you're there, wander across the street and have a look at the Grande Mosque; it isn't the same spectacle as Niamey's or even Tibiri's (see below), but it's worth a visit. "

AV_tHz0hbat9RzbdAMpi,Nepal,Patan,Palace,"  The  Palace  was built on the site of a fort that stood until 1734 and served as the residence of the Malla rulers of the then Patan state. It is divided up into a succession of courtyards (or “chowks”). Unfortunately only the last of these on the right (which houses the museum) is open on a regular basis, due to problems with theft of artifacts. Try peering through cracks in the doors to see what you are missing!  The first palace building is Sundari Chowk which was constructed in 1647. The three-storey temple on the palace side is the Degutale temple, constructed in 1661 after an earlier one burned down. Mul Chowk was the central part of the old palace and in recent times has suffered much theft of ornamental woodwork."

This is a great place to watch the sunrise or sunset over Pokhara. Tushita Nepal Meditation Retreats is just nearby. Indeed, it is the school of life. May you go there for engineering life and get the key for happiness and peace. www.tushitanepal.com. The easiest way to get there is to take a taxi to the base of the Peace Pagoda (NPR1000 return, including waiting). If you want to go on foot, you must first get to the southern side of Phewa Tal, either by walking around the lake or rowing across the lake. Then take a very steep hike (no switchbacks!) through the forest (watch out for leeches during the monsoon) or from the road that passes Devi's Fall, turning right at the end of Chhorepatan. To hike to the top: From the small fork road behind the bakery in Damside, go south 200m, past a few hotels to the road bridge over the big canal. Go southwest along smaller road to the cable bridge over the creek, notice the ""peace"" sign on bridge anchor cement. Cross, then go up steps to rite, hence main walking trail to left along rice fields. 200m to a small temple and water tap. Notice another peace sign and arrows pointing zig zag up behind tap. Follow the zig zag trail through the forest to steps and continue up them to the top of the ridge spur, follow the USA style tree ""blazes"" (notches in the tree trunks) wherever things get confusing. Follow the large trail through lovely forest with monkeys at times. Warning: there have been reports of a few robberies.

You can rent a motor bike for under NPR700 and take yourself to the top. The road is rough, but traversable. Great views, spectacular images and a great way to get a taste of what it's like to be trekking.
 Sarangkot south-slope trail . This is a somewhat demanding trail up Sarangkot Hill. To access it, go north through Lakeside through Kahare, and follow the road as it turns westward around the corner of the lake, toward Sedi Bogar village. Turn right at Caravan Restaurant. Follow the stone road (too rocky for a car or bike) 1 km directly north towards Sarankot's forested slopes, past some houses, to a school. The road ends to the right (east) of the school; follow the trail behind, east (right), which leads into a seasonal creek gully. 100m up this trail, before crossing the gully, the trail up to Sarangkot branches off to the left and soon the stone steps begin. (The start of the trail is a little hard to find; ask a local near the school if necessary.) Follow the steps all the way through a lot of jungle, follow the arrows carved into stones where confusing, cross the 4x4 road 3 times but stay on the stone steps, pass through some small villages until the steps finally end at a paved road with some restaurants and a school nearby. This is about 80% of the way up. From here the parasail jump-off is down the road a bit, 200m to the right; to get to Sarangkot, go left instead. Follow the road for a few hundred meters toward the final slope with the steps leading up easily visible by their railings. At the top of the steps is Sanrangkot village; there are a nummber of hotels, cafes, shops, and restaurants here, and the cement path leading up to the top is obvious. Morning views are best. The admission fee for the viewpoint on the summit is 50 rupees for foreigners, 20 for SAARC countries. At a regular hiking pace this trail takes about 90 minutes from the bottom at Caravan restaurant. Coming down the same way isn't much faster: the trail is too slippery and narrow to descend fast, and it's hard on the knees. Taking a taxi down the main road is an alternative, or possibly hitching a ride in a parasail truck going down."

If you note all the wires and cables across the streets at levels much lower than 25m. you can realise what a complicated exercise this is. The parade takes place between April and June, with the chariot staying the night at different locations. The end of the parade is supposed to coincide with the onset of the monsoon rains.

Scores of stalls sell a wide array of Moroccan fare (some overcharging heavily; see the Eat section) and you will almost certainly be accosted by women wanting to give you a henna tattoo. Enjoy the shows, but be prepared to give some dirhams to watch. By day it is largely filled with snake charmers and people with monkeys, as well as some of the more common stalls. Ignore anyone who offers you something that you do not want or move away: They will be asking you shortly for (too much) money. If you don't want to pay dearly for that henna or the photo of yourself with a monkey on your shoulder, politely decline when his owner approaches."
AV_tHz0ibat9RzbdAMti,Morocco,Marrakech,The Souks,"  The Souks  ( suuqs ), or markets of Marrakech, just adjacent to Place Djemaa El-Fna, are where you can buy almost anything. From spices to shoes, jellabas to kaftans, tea pots to tagines and much, much more. Undoubtedly, being a foreigner means you will end up paying higher prices than a native would, but bargain nonetheless. If you happen to run out of dirhams, you'll find plenty of people in the souks who will eagerly exchange your dollars or euros (though a fair rate here is less likely than at an official exchange). All that said, the sellers are much less aggressive than, say, Egypt or Turkey, so have fun!"
AV_tHz0ibat9RzbdAMtj,Morocco,Marrakech,Tanneries,"Tanneries  Visiting the Tanneries can be an interesting experience. Even if some people tell you the area is only for locals, it is possible to visit the Tanneries without paying a youngster. After finding a Tannery, ask one of the workers if you can visit it and take pictures. The tanneries are at the east end of Avenue Bab El Dabbagh. That 'main' tannery, Dar Dbagh, where they seem to channel all the tourists is near the Bab Debbagh gate. You'll be quickly approached by a guide who'll give you a sprig of mint and tell you that the tour is no charge. At the end of the tour you may be asked for as much as MAD100 for a ""tip"". This is far too much (€9). Give no more than MAD10-20 and ignore the evil looks they may give you. If you hate or are bad at haggling, show them before the tour how much you will pay them."
AV_tHz0ibat9RzbdAMtk,Morocco,Marrakech,Koutoubia Mosque,"  Koutoubia Mosque , right besides Djemaa El-Fna, is named after the booksellers market that used to be here.

At night, the mosque is beautifully lit. As with most mosques in Morocco, non-Muslims are not allowed inside."
AV_tHz0ibat9RzbdAMtl,Morocco,Marrakech,Saadian Tombs,"  Saadian Tombs  were not discovered until the beginning of the 20th century. They have been preserved just like they were during the glory days of the Saadian rulers. Unlike the El Badi Palace, they were not destroyed, probably for superstitious reasons. The entrance was blocked so they remained untouched for hundreds of years. Inside you will find an overload of Zelij (Morrocan tiles) and some beautiful decoration. Once inside, you can expect to wait in line for about 45 minutes to see the most impressive tomb. While here, look for the tombs of Jews and Christians; they are noted by their different markings and direction of the tomb. MAD10."

Inside the gardens is also the very small  Berber Museum , for which an additional entrance fee of MAD30 is charged. The garden museum used to host a much larger collection, but the more interesting artifacts are now waiting to be displayed in a new museum next door when it is finished building in the next few years. The Majorelle Café inside the gardens is a pretty and quiet place to rest and get a drink and some food, albeit at very high prices. As you are a captive audience, don't expect to be served haute cuisine. There is a gift shop filled with fascinating period photographs for sale (80-100 years old), though items are far from cheap.

Today, the Binnenhof houses the two chambers of the Dutch parliament and the Prime Minister's office in a small round tower opposite the Mauritshuis. Enter through one of the gates on Plein or Buitenhof and you will find yourself in a medieval enclosed courtyard, surrounded by architecture from the 13th up to the 19th century. There may be crowds gathered here on occasion because of public demonstrations, TV airings or receptions for foreign officials. In the middle stands the Knight's Hall, the original centrepiece of the castle, used for ceremonial purposes. The houses of parliament and the Knight's Hall are accessible in guided tours.

AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyU,Myanmar,Yangon,Entrance fee,"Entrance fee : US$8 or 8,000 kyat. Ticket booths are located at the top end of the flights of steps on all entrances. If you enter before the booths are opened, the ticket agents will catch up with you sooner or later and collect the fee. They are a team of three men, one of them carrying a thick book of receipts, all wearing I.D..  It is easy to avoid handing the US$8 fee to the government by simply asking for or buying a used sticker from another tourist as they leave the paya then going up one of the side entrances.  If you get in at 5:00 am and get out by 6:00 am you'll probably escape paying the fee (but risk not being allowed in). Ticket agents will sometimes quote the price in US Dollars (as per the sign) or Kyat (either at the government rate, the black-market rate, or an inflated black market rate). Best to have both available and pay whatever is cheapest. Tickets are valid for one day only (not a 24 hour period) and must be retained throughout your visit. While a sticker is to be displayed, is unusable the next day for a new colour is introduced. "
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyV,Myanmar,Yangon,Guides,"Guides : Guides, official and unofficial are available for US$5 (add a US$1/1,000 kyats tip). The quality is variable but most guides are friendly and trying to make their way against the odds. The pagoda is vast and complex and, if you can afford the extra dollars, the company and practical information on what's going around you is well worth the expense."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyW,Myanmar,Yangon,Getting there,"Getting there : Taxi from the city centre costs 2,500 kyats to 3,000 kyats (expect higher starting prices, especially if it has rained or is after dark - 3,000 kyats or so, feel free to haggle). Taxis are available for the return trip at the bottom of the main entrance. Can also take bus 204 looks like ၂၀၄, takes about 10 minutes with four stops 100 Kyats catch this on SHWE DAGON PAGODA RD across from Public Toliets just as you cross the overpass. From downtown Yangon, it's about a 30min walk that will take you past the Aung San Marketplace, Martyr's Mausoleum, and a beautiful park space.  If traveling internally by plane, it's likely that you'll need to go directly to the Air Mandalay office to pay for your paper tickets, from which you can walk here in a pleasant 10 min stroll by some beautiful scenery."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyX,Myanmar,Yangon,Food,"Food : The closest restaurant is at the intersection of the Shwedagon Pagoda Road and U Hlaung Bo Street (at the bottom of the Southern Walkway). There are some tea shops on a small roadway that describes a semicircle just below the top of the pagoda where you can get tea and biscuits. North of the pagoda, on Inya Road and outside the Savoy, are many places to eat, including a good fast food restaurant for pizza, coffee, and sandwiches. There are also several restaurants across the street from the western exit, by the entrance of the People's Park. Bring water; the heat of the sun can get to you if you visit during the daytime. No food or water is available on the platform itself but water is available on the lower reaches of the walkway."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyY,Myanmar,Yangon,Disabled travellers,"Disabled travellers : A road on the Southern side leads halfway up the Singuttara Hill and an elevator can take you the rest of the way.

The escalators are free for foreigners (or rather, included in the price of the ticket)."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyZ,Myanmar,Yangon,Dress code,"Dress code : Dress reasonably and keep your legs covered (long skirts, halfway between knee and ankle, are fine; shorts, on men or women, are not). Longyi is available at the ticket booth if you arrive overly uncovered."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMya,Myanmar,Yangon,Shoes,"Shoes : As with nearly all Buddhist monuments, footwear is not permitted. With the Shwedagon Paya, almost all visitors (and all locals) remove their footwear and socks at the gates before even setting foot inside the complex. There are places to leave your shoes at the bottom of every walkway for a nominal fee (5 kyats) but that can be a problem if, say, you enter using the Eastern walkway and wish to leave by the Northern. Carry a plastic shopping bag, pop your shoes into that bag, and carry it around with you while on the walkways and platforms. That is the Burmese way! If you can visit during the early morning or in the late afternoon / evening so the white marble tiles do not burn your feet."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyb,Myanmar,Yangon,Plan,"Plan  The Pagoda is actually shaped like a Greek cross. There are four entrances on each of the four cardinal directions - north, south, east, and west, flanked by gargantuan sculptures of mythical Burmese lions. These entrances open up to the four walkways as the appendages of the cross ascending to the top via flights of steps. At the top is the octagonal intersection of the cross which consists of the Stupa at the very center itself surrounded by shrines that can qualify as temples by themselves and separated from the Stupa by a vast open walkway paved with spic and span shiny marble tiles. The Stupa is further surrounded by a string of micro shrines - small celled structures housing the icon of the Buddha himself and interspersed by lion sculptures, and then further inwards, another string of micro stupas surround the Stupa superstructure. "
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyc,Myanmar,Yangon,Walkways to The Pagoda,"Walkways to The Pagoda  Four covered walkways lead up to the pagoda from the plains surrounding the hills. The Eastern walkway is the most interesting, crowded as it is with vendors selling items for pilgrims (candles, flowers, gold leaf, stones and other paraphernalia of Burmese Buddhist worship) and souvenirs for domestic (and international) tourists (Buddhas, lacquer ware, and  thanaka ). Nothing tacky is for sale, so do stop and take a look. The other walkways are less interesting but the Western walkway has escalators and the Southern has an elevator. Walking up the Eastern walkway to the top and allowing the beauty of the pagoda it to emerge remains the best way to get up the hill!"

AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyh,Myanmar,Yangon,The Pagoda Platform,"The Pagoda Platform  Although similar in concept to Mecca's kaaba surrounded by a vast space, the Pagoda platform where people may make rounds around the Stupa, exists as a religious space without pomp and circumstance and is one of the best places in the world to sit and people watch. Find a comfortable step, or sit yourself on the floor, and look around. Children run up and down, perhaps singing and shouting with abandon. Women cluster in groups gossiping. Couples, young and old stroll up and down. Burgundy robed monks are everywhere. Here and there, at the many shrines that dot the platform and sit around the stupa, people pray, seriously and silently. Bells ring. There is no awe here, only life, religious and secular life. Sit there long enough and someone will stop to chat with you, to ask questions, to exchange information."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyi,Myanmar,Yangon,Day Shrines,"Day Shrines  There are eight shrines, one for each day of the week (in the Burmese calendar, Wednesday is divided into two parts), dotted around the eight corners of the stupa (the stupa is octagonal), and most Burmese pray at their day shrine when visiting a pagoda. If you can figure out the day of the week when you were born, light a candle, place some flowers, or pour water over the shrine corresponding to that day. Starting from the Southern entrance, and going clockwise, the eight planetary posts are: Mercury (Wednesday morning, before noon), Saturn (Saturday), Jupiter (Thursday), Rahu (no planet, Wednesday afternoon), Venus (Friday), Sun (Sunday), Moon (Monday), Mars (Tuesday). Each shrine also has a beast associated with it, the most interesting one being the  Gahlon , a mythical half-bird half-beast said to guard Mount Meru (the shrine for Sunday)."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyk,Myanmar,Yangon,The Arakanese Prayer Pavilion,"The Arakanese Prayer Pavilion , a little before the Western Walkway, was a gift of the Rakhaing people of Arakan. The prayer hall itself is ordinary, but the wood carvings on the roof are exquisite, probably the finest in the Pagoda complex."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyl,Myanmar,Yangon,Maha Ganda Bell,"Maha Ganda Bell  Known locally as the Singu Min Bell (after King Singu, who donated it to Shwedagon), the Maha Ganda bell was cast between 1775 and 1779 and weighs 23 tonnes. Impressed by the size of the bell, the British attempted to take it as war booty after the First Burmese War (1825) but dropped it into the Yangon River instead. The story goes that the British tried everything to get the bell out of the water but all their technology was of no avail. Giving up, they told the Burmese that they could have it back if they could get it out of the water. The Burmese shoved some bamboo rafts and, lo behold, powered by rafts or by divine right, the bell floated to the surface and was returned to the pagoda! Pick up a mallet and bang on the bell for luck. Behind the bell, a small pavilion provides excellent views of the stupa (spectacular at night) and a panoramic view of the city."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMym,Myanmar,Yangon,Naungdawgyi Pagoda and Sandawdwin Tazaung,"Naungdawgyi Pagoda and Sandawdwin Tazaung  Left of the Northern walkway, the Naungdawgyi or Elder pagoda is supposed to mark the spot where the sacred strands of the Buddha's hair were placed and washed before being enshrined in the stupa. (Women are not allowed onto the Elder pagoda platform.) Close by is the Sandawdwin Tazaung (Hair Relics Well) which provided the water for the washing. The well is odd because it is fed by the Irrawaddy rather than by ground water and the level of water in this well rises and falls with the tides!"

AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyo,Myanmar,Yangon,Sule Paya (Sule Pagoda),"  Sule Paya (Sule Pagoda) , incongruously serving as a traffic island in the middle of the busiest intersection in central Yangon, Sule Paya is a 46 m octagonal-shaped stupa that, according to the local story, was built 2000 years ago to house a strand of the Buddha's hair. Whether or not it has a strand of the Buddha's hair, the galleries of the pagoda are an oasis of calm from the chaotic traffic that passes around it all day long. Admission used to be free but foreigners must now pay a 4,000 kyat/US$3 admission charge. Shoes can be left at counters at any entrance but carry a plastic bag."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAMyp,Myanmar,Yangon,Botataung Paya,"  Botataung Paya  A few blocks East of The Strand Hotel along the Yangon River lies the Botataung Pagoda. The original pagoda was destroyed by allied bombing during the Second World War but the site has a legendary history as long as that of the Shwedagon or the Sule Paya, and it is supposed to house more strands of the Buddha's hair brought to the site by a thousand soldiers (hence the name which means '1,000 officers'). The rebuilt stupa is hollow inside, and many relics (not the hair though) are on display. While not spectacular like the Shwedagon, the river-front setting and the hollow stupa make it worth visiting."

This museum has one of the most quality collections in Southeast Asia - the best of Myanmar artistic heritage and superior craftsmanship - both Myanmar masters and unknown craftsmen but unfortunately it is in a wrong Third World hands.

The showcasing itself is the worse of the state of the art - captions and storyboards as if done by high school students for a school open house fair, graphics, most are handwritten, specimen documents in blueprint or photocopies, showcase cabinets that cry louder and take the thunder of attention from the display itself for its too much intricately and unnecessarily carvings.

It is cheaper to walk along the road footpath (sidewalk) with free view from the outside looking through the fenced park. Caution: If intending to go to the boardwalk, be careful where you are entering because a wrong entry means money down the drain that should have been allotted to a more noble purpose such as donating to a beggar. To go to the lake itself, you have to be ready to cough out the amount stated above to be paid at the entrance located in the middle of the south side road. But if your real intention is to get close to the Karaweik, the entrance is on the southeast corner and there is a separate charge. The charge to the Karaweik is 300 kyats. The lake is separated from the Karaweik by a fence and there is no way of simply crossing over although the view from the street outside looks like they are all integrated."

AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM0B,Malta,Gozo,The Azure Window,"The Azure Window , the  Inland Sea  and the the  Blue Hole  all make going to the spectacular west coast of Gozo very worthwhile. The Azure Window is a cliff outcropping with a hole in the middle. The Inland Sea is a typically Maltese name in that it slightly exaggerates its size (Mdina is referred to as a city with its 400 inhabitants). It's actually a small lake connected to the sea by a tunnel about 100 meters long through the cliffs. In contrast to Xlendi and Marsalforn this place has been spared from development and makes an unusual and picturesque place to swim. The beach surrounding the lake is unfortunately made of pebbles but there are a few piers and terraces in front of the fishermen's boathouses one can also use. The Blue Hole is not a true blue hole in the geological sense but still makes an amazing spot to dive, having won awards as one of the most beautiful diving spots of Europe. Unfortunately, on Wednesday 8th March, 2017, the Azure Window collapsed after its outer column crumbled down as a result of typical gale winds and strong waves at this time of the year, natural processes which have and are still continuously eroding the coast, mainly on this side (west coast) of the islands. A stump is all that is left to be seen."

Don't be put off by the first impression of a warehouse full of junk: the museum is actually a large, sprawling, multi-level complex, and the more impressive lifesize dioramas lie elsewhere, the star of the show being the mock-up of the night-time Sauer river crossing at Diekirch on January 18, 1945.  Showrooms feature very extensive collections of weapons, small arms, uniforms, military equipment of all kinds, wheeled and tracked vehicles, in addition to numerous personal soldier’s belongings, photographs, documents and maps.  There are also exhibitions of Luxembourg's contributions to various UN peacekeeping efforts and even an exhibit on the Soviet gulag that some Luxembourgish soldiers ended up in after the war.  The presentation is starting to look rather dated, but there's still plenty to keep military and history buffs busy. The total number of artifacts on display is in the thousands, and it is easily the largest collection on the Battle of the Bulge in the entire region. The museum places a special emphasis on the impact the battle had on local civilians. Several tanks and artillery pieces outside.

AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM2e,Laos,Luang Prabang,Alms ceremony,"  Alms ceremony  — monks at dawn (05:30) collecting alms of rice from kneeling villagers and tourists, who form the majority, along Sakkaline Road near Wat Sensoukharam. Just look for the long row of rice baskets and stools that have been laid out for tourists who have paid for the privilege of giving alms. Seeing these tourists, who make up the majority of the alms-givers, seated on plastic stools participating out of fun rather than sincerity definitely reduces the authenticity of the moment. To make things worse, some are dressed inappropriately: please, if you want to give alms, at least cover up and do not show the monks your cleavage. If you are white, please keep a distance from the monks so people can take authentic photos without a European backpacker getting in the way. Ask your guest house host to assist you the day before in preparing if you'd like to get up and give alms in the morning. Please note that the alms giving ceremony is one which, while picturesque, is not without its detractors. Unscrupulous local merchants have used the eagerness of tourists to participate in a local tradition as a means of making easy money, and sometimes sell unsuitable, stale and even unsafe food. This has resulted in monks falling ill after having consumed the offerings, and resistance to continuing the tradition. However, the government has made it clear that the monks have to continue the tourist pageant or risk being replaced with lay people clothed in saffron robes in order to keep up appearances, and thereby maintain tourist revenue. So if you wish to participate in this ceremony, prepare the food or fruit yourself, and avoid giving food of unknown quality. Another problem is the photography: while it looks nice on your collection, think about how it must feel for the monks to have hundreds of tourists photographing them every day. Some lowlifes even stand right next to them, flashing them in the eyes. Strongly consider only watching this old tradition from a distance instead of using it as a tourist attraction, as this may detract from the beauty of the ritual - both for locals and tourists alike. You can always download a picture of it somewhere on the net for your collection."

There are multiple pools at different levels, all of which are reportedly safe to bathe in, and are extremely picturesque. Shared tuk-tuks to go there charge about 30 to 50,000 kip. The cheapest seems to be near slow boat pier, though you can get them for 40,000 kip near JoMa Bakery. You may have to wait until the tuk-tuk fills up. Tuk-tuks are legally only allowed to take six people, and there is a checkpoint at the falls, so some drivers may try to get a 7th person in the front seat. A private tuk-tuk will cost you around 150,000 kip after some haggling. Drivers will try to show you some documents that quote 200,000 kip or more. Ignore it and insist on your price. Try and go with 5 people and insist on 30,000 kip each. Drivers should wait for 3-4 hours for you at the waterfall gate area. Make sure your 150,000 kip includes transport there and back. Bargain, bargain, bargain. Just remember that there are dozens of tuk-tuks around, so you have the advantage. If on your own, propose 30,000 kip, and if you have the patience wait until he finds more people. A seat in a mini bus costs 40,000 kip, more if booked through travel agent.

It's also possible to finish the trip at the ""whisky village"" where the local Laolao rice spirit is made. Those caves were used as a storage unit to keep the damaged Buddha statues (it is considered bad luck to throw them away, so they are often stored in caves) and were made a tourist attraction; if you ever been to any cave before, it is not worth a dedicated visit as you're likely to be disappointed. There are two caves: one on the entry level and another, the upper caves, on top of the hill, a very steep climb. A torch is recommended to see the upper cave, and will be given on entrance. Ticket for a round boat tour to Pak Ou Caves (with stop at the whisky village) costs 65,000 kip (Jan. 2015) per person and can be purchased at the pier (first boat takes off at 08:30 but the ticket office is open at 8). If you book a ""half-day tour Pak Ou"" at the local tourist office, make sure if the entrance fee is included in the price, or the whole ""service"" to be provided is just selling you a boat ticket with surcharge; in the latter case, just go to the pier (at Mekong river, easy to find) and buy the tickets yourself.

AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM3i,Lithuania,Telšiai,Old Town of Telšiai,The beautiful Old Town of Telšiai represents an urban monument.

AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM3t,Laos,Vientiane,Hophakaew Museum,"  Hophakaew Museum . Entrance fee 5,000 kip. Thanon Setthathirat (opposite Wat Si Saket). An elegant, and majestic structure, King Setthathirat's former royal temple, which housed the magical Emerald Buddha ( pha kaew ) after it was taken from Lanna ( Chiang Mai ). The Siamese took it back in 1779 - the image is now housed in  Bangkok 's  Wat Phra Kaew  - and came back in 1828 to raze the temple for good measure. The present structure is a 1942 reconstruction of dubious provenance. The temple no longer operates and the interior has been turned into a small jumbled museum housing Buddha images; look out for the beautiful tall, lithe, long-armed Buddha in the hands-down ""calling for rain"" pose."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM3u,Laos,Vientiane,Black Stupa,"  Black Stupa  ( That Dam ). Thanon Bartholomie (off Thanon Samsenthai near the US embassy). The mythical abode of a seven-headed dragon that protects Vientiane. It was renovated in 1995 but still has an attractive patina of age, and is slowly being overgrown again by lush grass vegetation.  Warning: there have been dog attacks here at night."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM3v,Laos,Vientiane,Pha That Luang,"  Pha That Luang . 5,000 kip Entrance fee (2,000 kip for Laotians). Thanon That Luang (2 km east from Patuxai). The national symbol and most important religious monument of the country, That Luang is a three-layered gilded stupa. The current version dates from 1566, although it has been ransacked and renovated numerous times since then. All days 08:00-12:00, 13:00-16:00. Accessing the inner courtyard gives you a slightly closer view of the stupa, and lots of Buddha statues. Vientiane's most important festival,  Bun That Luang , is held here in November on the night of the full moon."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM3w,Laos,Vientiane,Wat That Luang Neua," There are two temples beside That Luang:  Wat That Luang Neua  to the north(ish) and  Wat That Luang Tai  to the south(ish), both presently being renovated."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM3x,Laos,Vientiane,Wat Si Muang,"  Wat Si Muang . Between Thanons Setthatirat and Samsenthai, about 1km east of the centre. Free. Disney-esque and gaudy in set-up, one would not think that it's a religious compound. Despite its small size, the temple is very active. Followers believe that lifting the small Buddha statue 3 times from its cushion means that your prayers or questions will be answered. The city pillar is being housed in a pagoda-like structure now being constructed separately on another block northwest across the street. "
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM3y,Laos,Vientiane,"Wats Onteu, Inpeng, Mixay","  Wats Onteu, Inpeng, Mixay  and  Haisok  are along Thanon Setthatirat right in the town centre, and therefore the most likely temples to be visited by tourists."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM3z,Laos,Vientiane,Buddha Park,"  Buddha Park  ( Xieng Khuan ) is a bizarre outdoor collection of huge concrete sculptures of Buddhist and Hindu deities, and real and imaginary beasts. The reclining Buddha is especially impressive. Built in 1958 by mystic Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat, who left the country after the communist take-over, and in 1978 established a similar but more impressive park ( Sala Keoku  or  Sala Kaew Ku ) across the river in  Nong Khai ,  Thailand . Located 24 km from the city, it's about 6 km to the east of the Friendship Bridge - hence it's well worth visiting on the way into or out of Laos if you're crossing the Friendship Bridge, as this will save a 48 km round trip if you visit from and return to Vientiane. The Buddha Park entrance fee is 5,000LAK. There is technically a 3,000LAK camera fee, but officials weren't interested in collecting this fee (as of Feb 2016)."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM30,Laos,Vientiane,National Ethnic Cultural Park," On the main road (Thanon Thadeua), just before the access road to the Bridge branches off, is the  National Ethnic Cultural Park  where typical houses of various ethnic groups are on display, although only from the outside unless a custodian unlocks some of them. There also are some statues of dinosaurs and a rather dismal small ""zoo"". Generally the only activity are kiosks selling drinks and snacks, but there are said to be occasional cultural shows. Tour operators often take their guests here before or after a visit to the Buddha Park. Well, but it is not a place to go out of your way to visit."
AV_tHz0jbat9RzbdAM31,Laos,Vientiane,Lao National Museum,"Formerly the Lao Revolutionary Museum by name, the historical exhibits on the first floor are modest though very interesting in depicting some of the early history. They include one of the original Jars from the Plain of Jars and various stone and bronze age implements. The second floor provides us with a great insight into the 18th Century Laotian Kingdom and the customs of the day. It would appear that the Loatians didn't treat their guests quite as well in those days, often keeping them from leaving the country for several months. The floor builds up to a fervently revolutionary pitch as it documents the heroic struggle of the Lao against the Siamese (Thai), French and American imperialists. Exhibits include items such as socks worn by Politburo members when they escaped from prison and Kaysone Phomvihane's chest expander. The final rooms, on post-revolutionary Laos, are mostly a photo gallery of pressing topics such as the comrades of the 7th Plenary Session of the Laos People's Congress inspecting fertilizer production processes. The final rooms provide an insight into some of the modern advancements, though these are fairly dowdy and uninspiring. A guestbook regularly features amusing arguments between young western visitors on the subject of communism. Most exhibits are labelled in English, though some French labelling remains, occasionally to the exclusion of English."

Besides the elaborate Buddhist embellishment, it differs from the original in having four gates instead of two and being just a bit higher (to trump the French). Reasonably impressive from afar, a surprisingly frank English sign inside the monument labels it a ""monster of concrete"" when seen up close - and the concrete in question was donated by the US, although it was supposed to go towards a new airport instead: hence the nickname ""the Vertical Runway"". The monument itself aside, the palm tree-lined park around it complete with fountains is quite pleasant though lacking of shade during the day time. You can climb up to the 7th story for a nice view of central Vientiane and three levels of souvenir shops with less than enthusiastic sales people sitting about.

Tin dredges work by scooping up bucket loads of tin-bearing soil at the front end, which then passes through an oscillating drum and a system of jigs and screens to extract the tin, before spewing out the waste material at the rear end through a number of chutes.  This dredge was built for the Southern Malayan Tin Dredging Ltd, a company formed in 1926 which operated a further 5 dredges in the Batu Gajah and Tanjung Tualang area. TT5 was in operation for 44 years until 1982 by which time the Malaysian tin industry was in rapid decline due to a combination of exhausted tin deposits, low tin prices, and high operating costs.  All the tin mining and dredging activity which took place for over a hundred years have left behind a pockmarked landscape running for hundreds of miles down the length of Peninsular Malaysia.

Amazingly, as it was never in the colonial power's interest and the Maltese had to do without writing in their own language since the Arabs left in the 11th century.

However, the Sistine Chapel is very crowded and getting there through the corridors of the Vatican Museum is even worse. It is easy for families to get separated so determine a meeting point. The best part of St. Peter's Basilica is that kids can go to the top of the dome. It is 500 steps but you can take the elevator up to the third floor. From there there are another 323 exhausting steps. So it is fun for older kids who can both climb up all the stairs and walk down as there is a huge line for the elevator. "

A valuable work of art kept in the Basilica is an ancient painting of Our Blessed Mother, in front of which the other great apostle of India, St. Francis Xavier, used to pray. There are two new structures today:  The Tomb Chapel  below the Basilica and  Museum cum theatre . The new underground chapel with a separate access outside the church structure, allows pilgrims to pray at the tomb and tourists to visit it, without disturbing the sacred functions in the church. The museum exhibits artifacts connected with St. Thomas and the Basilica, and the theatre is used for screening a short video on the life of the Apostle.    edit"
AV_tHz0lbat9RzbdANBz,India,Chennai,"St. Mary's Church,","  St. Mary's Church,  situated in the fort, is one of  the oldest surviving churches built by the British  in India. This is the first English church in India and the oldest Anglican church in the East.Designed by William Dixon, the then Master Gunner of the Fort, it was constructed under the supervision of the Governor Streynsham Master. Given the precarious nature of the English presence in India at the time (not to mention later attacks by the French and the locals), the church has a defensive stance- thick walls, castellated parapets and a well within the grounds - to withstand any bombardment or siege). The church was consecrated on 28 October 1680. The tower was completed in 1701; the steeple added in 1710 and the tower was connected to the main body of the church in 1759. Robert Clive - more famous as Clive of India- married Margaret Maskelyne here in 1753. The first but equally famous wedding was that of Governor Elihu Yale (who was to become the benefactor of Yale College) to Catherine Himmers in November 1680. The interior of the church contains many fascinating plaques and monuments to early British India evoking past glories and lives full of achievement. It also contains the old colours of the Madras Fusiliers, the first European regiment of the East India Company.

He is believed to have reached South India in AD 52, and spent the last years of his life in a cave on this hill. Tradition states that Thomas was assassinated by an arrow in AD 72, by persons hostile to him. Thus, the hillock acquired the name St. Thomas Mount. Over time Anglo-Indians predominated in this area.

The main sights within the fort include the  , adorned with thousands on thousands of mirror tiles on the walls and ceiling.

The establishment of Fort St. George marked the birth of the new city that is Madras, in the year 1640. The fort was named after St George who is believed to have preached in the region.

One year later they built the fort as a commanding post in the region.

Home to the famous  Daibutsu  (大仏), at almost 15 meters the second largest Buddha statue in Japan (after  Katsuyama 's Buddha at 17 meters) and one of the largest in the world. The Daibutsu-den, which houses it, is said to be the largest wooden building in the world and is a  UNESCO World Heritage  site. The giant front gate,  Nandai-mon , is guarded by two fierce, awe-inspiring protectors. It's also swarmed by deer, who know this is the best place to come looking for a hand-out. Through the gate is a stone path leading to the outer walls surrounding the Daibutsu-den. Follow the signs to the left to enter the inner courtyard, and if you happen to have a stick of incense with you, join the crowd around the incense offerings before you head onward.   The  Daibutsu-den  contains four other giant statues. Once you've taken in the Daibutsu itself, walk around it to the left to see the other statues, as well as a few old tiles and leftover relics. There's a stand inviting you to sponsor a tile in order to help with the upkeep of the temple, and English-language fortune scrolls ( omikuji ) are on sale year-round. Take a final look at the Daibutsu as you leave; don't let the souvenir stand be your last memory of this incredible sight.   Just before the souvenir area, behind and to the right of the Daibutsu, is a wooden column with a small hole carved through the bottom. Enlightenment is reportedly promised to anyone who can squeeze through this hole. In practice, this means a lot of kids have enlightenment in store (thanks in part to other kids who kick their feet to ""help"" them through), and all but the skinniest adults can only look on in envy.   To the right of the entrance to the Daibutsu-den is a statue of the  Yakushi Nyorai . Though a bit scary-looking on first glance, it's actually a Buddha of medicine and healing. Touching a part of the Yakushi Nyorai and then the corresponding part of your own body is said to heal any ailments you have there.   ¥500 .  ( 34.686905 , 135.839274 )   edit"

AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANH8,Japan,Nara,Isui-en Garden,"This small but immaculately kept garden is often overlooked despite being just around the corner (literally) from Todai-ji.  Isui-en is what you'd get if you boiled down some of the larger, better known gardens until you were left with a concentrated broth of garden perfection.  Smaller spaces and less traffic means more attention to detail from the gardeners, and Isui-en has everything you'd expect (just smaller). From the lush moss carpets to the carefully trimmed trees, waterfalls, rocky landscape, ponds and bridges, this garden deserves a slow pace. There is a small museum on the grounds that is included in the price, worthwhile mainly for its air conditioning in the summer months."

The Buddhist Yakushi trinity housed in the   is a great work, and the the two pagodas on each side of the temple make it a unique and recognizable complex. The east pagoda has survived and dates back to 730 AD. Like Gango-ji, Yakushi-ji was one of the seven top temples in the city during the Nara Period."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIB,Japan,Nara,Gangō-ji,"It was considered to be one of the seven most important temples in Nara back in the days when Nara was the nation's capital. The original temple burned down in the 18th century, but the architectural style remains true to the original, with its unique Korean-style roof. The mandala within the temple is one of the most famous in the nation. Around the outside of the temple there are many Buddhist statues, but perhaps more interesting are the various demon statues scattered about among them. While the Buddhist statues are quite typical and obviously religious, the demon statues are comical and seem out-of-place. Some even appear sacrilegious, with a demon doing Zen meditation among the Buddhist statues and another in a rather erotic centerfold-like pose. There is a story that supposedly associates the demons with the temple. For visitors, it is fun to try to spot them all."

AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIP,Japan,Hiroshima,A-Bomb Dome," The skeletal remains of the  A-Bomb Dome  (原爆ドーム  Genbaku Dōmu ) are the most recognizable symbol of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima. In another lifetime, the building was one of the city's best-known sights for an entirely different reason; designed by Czech architect Jan Letzel in 1915, the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall (and its fanciful green dome) had a bold European style in a grimy, crowded city with few modern flourishes. Because the explosion took place almost directly above the building, the walls remained largely intact, even as the dome shattered and the people inside were killed by the heat of the blast. Initially, as the city rebuilt, it was left alone simply because it was more difficult to demolish than other remains in the area; gradually, the A-Bomb Dome became the symbol it is today. The ""Hiroshima Peace Memorial"" was declared a  UNESCO World Heritage site  in 1996 amid some controversy — the  United States  and  China  both voted against the nomination for reasons related to the war. Today, the benches around the Dome are a favorite spot for Hiroshima natives to read, eat lunch, or simply relax."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIQ,Israel,Tiberias,Hamath Tiberias National Park,"Hamath Tiberias National Park   [8]  - Israel's spa craze actually has a 2000-year-old history which started at the hot springs of Hammat Tiberias when, during Roman times, they were the focus, if not raison d'être, of a community of 40,000 fervent bathers. Check out the history of the site at the Hammat Tiberias National Park, which features a small museum in what was originally part of a Turkish bathhouse. The main highlight is a synagogue dating from the 3rd to 5th centuries AD, which has a beautiful zodiac mosaic floor. Much has been made of the mosaic's curious mix of Jewish and pagan symbols, but somehow this seems quite apt in Tiberias, a town that, historically, seems to have been able to reconcile the spiritual with the more earthly. The fame of Hammat Tiberias was such that in AD 110 the Emperor Trajan had a coin struck dedicated to the springs - with the image of Hygeia, the goddess of health, shown sitting on a rock, enjoying the water. The springs were also mentioned by Al-Idris, an Arab writer who lived during the Crusades, and were recommended by the Jewish sage Rambam to his patients."

AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIa,Japan,Hiroshima,Peace Bell," The  Peace Bell  is engraved with a world map, drawn without borders to symbolize unity. The public are welcomed to ring the bell — not coincidentally, the log is aimed to strike an atomic symbol.  (Ring the bell gently, so as not to damage it.)"
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIb,Japan,Hiroshima,Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound," The  Atomic Bomb Memorial Mound  holds the ashes of 70,000 bomb victims who were unidentified or had no living relatives to claim them. Services are held in their memory on the 6th of every month."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIc,Japan,Hiroshima,Rest House," The  Rest House  was known as the  Taishoya Kimono Shop  at the time of the explosion. Only one employee, who was in the basement at the time, survived. However, the reinforced concrete building stayed mostly intact. (The interior has been entirely refurbished, but the preserved basement is possible to visit with advance request.) Today, it holds a gift shop, some vending machines, a helpful tourist information office, and — as the name would suggest — a place to rest."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANId,Japan,Hiroshima,Cenotaph for the A-Bomb Victims," Inside the  Cenotaph for the A-Bomb Victims  is a stone chest with a registry that is intended to contain the names of every known person who died from the bombing, regardless of nationality. (Names are added as  hibakusha  pass away from diseases thought related to the radiation of the bomb.) The Japanese inscription reads, ""Let all the souls here rest in peace, for the evil shall not be repeated."" Note how the arch frames the A-Bomb Dome in the distance."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIe,Japan,Hiroshima,Flame of Peace, At the other end of the pond from the Cenotaph is the  Flame of Peace  (平和の灯  heiwa no tomoshibi ). It is said that the fire will burn until the last nuclear weapon is gone from the earth. 
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIf,Israel,Tiberias,The tomb of Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon,"The tomb of Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon  is the final resting place of the Spanish physician, also known as Maimonides or Rambam, who worked in the court of the Muslim ruler Saladin. This revered rabbi, who died in 1204, was one of 12th-century Egypt's most highly regarded sages. Legend has it that before his death in Cairo, he instructed followers to load his remains onto a camel and bury him wherever the camel expired. The camel was apparently drawn to Tiberias.Next to Rabbi Moshe Ben Maimon's tomb lies Rabbi Yohanan Ben Zakkai, the Holy Land's most eminent sage at the time of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. Ben Zakkai is said to have faked his own death, escaping the city in a coffin and jumping out of the casket in front of the Roman general Vespasian who he prophesied would become the new Caesar. When the prophecy came true, Ben Zakkai was granted one wish by the new leader; a Jewish learning centre for him and students."

AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIo,Israel,Tiberias,St Peter's Church,"St Peter's Church  Hidden along the northern promenade it is worth looking out for the lovely Franciscan church built by 12th-century Crusaders. The Muslims converted it into a mosque, and you can make out an area of uneven stone on the southern wall filling in the hole where a mihrab (prayer niche indicating the direction of Mecca) was carved. Later, the Turks used the building as a caravanserai before it was rebuilt as a church in 1870. "
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIp,Israel,Tiberias,Al-Amari Mosque,"As out of place as a pin-stripe suited gent at a teenage rave, the dignified little  Al-Amari Mosque  looks threatened and lost squeezed between some gaudy shops and a brusque concrete supermarket. Built by Daher al-Omar in the mid-18th century, the mosque is one of the very few buildings in Tiberias that predates 1948. It is generally held that its construction was partly paid for by the town's Jewish community, presumably grateful to the sheikh for being permitted to return."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIq,Japan,Kanazawa,Kenroku-en Garden,"  Kenroku-en Garden  (兼六園),  [8] .  The most famous sight in Kanazawa, the Garden of Six Attributes is considered one of  Japan's Top 3  gardens.  Once the outer pleasure gardens of the Maeda Lords, it gradually expanded to take over the entire block. While not completed in its final form until the waning years of the Edo Shogunate, it still represents one of the peaks of Japanese strolling garden design. The way in which water is piped from many kilometres upstream to fill its streams and ponds before going on to fill the castle moats is one of the great engineering feats of the Edo period. In part of the grounds, and with a steep separate ¥700 entrance fee, is the Seisonkaku Villa, build by a Maeda lord for his mother. Only part of it remains today, but is a rare example of existing daimyo palace architecture. The upper floor, with its bright blues and reds, is in distinct contrast to the muted earth tones of Kyoto style.  ¥300, and ¥100 for children age 6-17.  7AM-6PM daily.  During cherry blossom season, entry to the park is free and it's open and lit up until 9 PM."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIr,Israel,Safed,Artist colony,"  Artist colony  in the Old City. This includes the Exhibition Centre in Safed Big Mosque, and a growing number of small, private art galleries, many of which have little cafes or tourist shops attached, selling postcards, t-shirts, and other basic tourist goods."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIs,Israel,Safed,The Crusader Fortress,"  The Crusader Fortress  - at the top of the Old City hill. Some interesting walls and buildings are visible, but unlike most Israeli archaeological sites, do not have helpful explanatory signs. The top of the hill boasts an incredible view of the surroundings. If your legs are strong enough, visit during the day to see the surrounding forested mountains, and visit again at night to see the ring of lights around the Sea of Galilee. Beware that the access path to the top is somewhat under construction (as of August 2012) - there is no fence at the path's edge, and no lighting at night."

AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIw,Japan,Hiroshima,Statue of Mother and Child in the Storm," The  Statue of Mother and Child in the Storm , completed in 1960 by artist Shin Hongo, is among the most powerful works of art created in response to the atomic bomb. It depicts a woman shielding her child from the black rain. It's in front of the  Fountain of Prayer  just south of the Peace Memorial Museum."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIx,Japan,Hiroshima,Gates of Peace," The  Gates of Peace  were installed in 2005 on Heiwa-o-dori, just south of the Peace Park, by a pair of French artists. On the sidewalk and the surface of the gates, the word ""peace"" is written in 49 languages. The ten gates are meant to represent the nine circles of hell from Dante's  Inferno , plus a new one: the hell created by the atomic bombing."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIy,Japan,Hiroshima,historical markers," As you explore the city and outskirts, keep an eye out for maroon-colored marble  historical markers  such as the one outside the A-Bomb Dome or the one marking the Hypocenter, which have photographs and text in both Japanese and English. You'll come across markers as far as a few miles away from the Peace Park — which lends perspective to the distance and extent of the damage."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANIz,Japan,Hiroshima,Bank of Japan," After the A-Bomb Dome, the former  Bank of Japan  at 5-16 Fukuro-machi, Naka-ku ( Fukuro-machi tram stop ) is the best-known pre-bomb structure in Hiroshima. Built in 1936, the city's main branch of the  Nippon Ginko  was only 380 meters from the hypocenter; although its exterior remained intact, all 42 people inside the bank were killed by the heat of the blast. Remarkably, the bank was back in service only two days after the bomb and continued operation until 1992, when it was acquired by the city. Occasional art exhibitions are now held there. Hours of access are irregular, but it's worth stopping by to check."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANI0,Japan,Hiroshima,Hiroshima Mitsui Bank," Somewhat incongruously, the 1925  Hiroshima Mitsui Bank  at 7-1 Hon-dori, Naka-ku ( Hon-dōri tram stop ) also survived the blast, and now serves as home of a busy Andersen Bakery. The ground-level renovations and the ceiling of the Hon-dori arcade combine to obscure its age, but there's a historical marker on the corner. Stepping out of Hon-dori to the side street gives a better view of the building — and how the city rebuilt around it."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANI1,Japan,Hiroshima,pre-bomb house," There is a fascinating, little-known  pre-bomb house  on the outskirts of  Hijiyama Park . Walk up toward the park on the street branching upward from the Hijiyamashita tram stop. You'll see a temple on your left with a historical marker out front. Just past the temple is a set of stone steps, leading up to a small house and explanatory plaque. (Notice the vane at the top of the house, warped from the heat of the bomb.) Please note that while visitors are welcome in the front yard, the rest of the area is private property, including the house itself."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANI2,Japan,Hiroshima,Peace Pagoda," From the Shinkansen side of JR Hiroshima Station, you'll see an enigmatic silver tower on Futaba-yama, the mountain ahead. That's the  Peace Pagoda  ( Busshari-to ), built in 1966 in memory of those killed by the atomic bomb. To reach it, simply head uphill on the main street facing away from the station. You'll pass through a quiet, pleasant neighborhood of cafes and hillside houses, climb steps, and eventually reach  Toshogu Shrine . Follow the road around the shrine and you'll reach the red lanterns and  torii  of  Kinko Inari Shrine . Head through the gates and up the steps to reach the Peace Pagoda. It's an even more impressive sight from the top of the mountain; inside the Pagoda are two gifts containing ashes of the Buddha, which were a gift to Hiroshima from  India  and a group of  Mongolian  Buddhists, along with thousands of prayer stones. You'll also be able to see the whole jumble of the city below."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANI3,Japan,Hiroshima,Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims,"The Peace Memorial Hall is dedicated to collecting names and photographs of people who died in the blast. The entrance of the museum leads downward to a quiet hall for contemplation, and then back up again to a set of kiosks with compelling stories and recollections from survivors (in English and Japanese). Like the Cenotaph and the Peace Memorial Museum, it was designed by architect Kenzo Tange."

In the courtyard of the Sephardic synagogue is a pillar topped by a large bowl, and four days before the Lag B'Omer holiday a bonfire is lit here on the Pesah Sheni (second Passover). Crowds of religious Jews visit throughout the year to pray and it is a belief that God will answer the prayers of pilgrims with personal problems."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANI6,Japan,Kanazawa,Kanazawa Castle Site,"  Kanazawa Castle Site .  At the centre of Kanazawa is the former site of Kanazawa's castle. Recently vacated by the national university, which took over the site once used by the Ninth Division of the Imperial Army, the castle is public space now for the first time in its 400-plus years of history. The imposing  Ishikawa Gate  (石川門), so named as it faced the Ishikawa district, was once a side entrance to the castle grounds, but after several fires and man-made destruction, it is one of the few original buildings left on the site, the other being the  Sanjikken Nagaya  (三十間長屋) storehouse near the top. However the long  Gojikken Nagaya  (五十間長屋) that once guarded the castle palace has recently been rebuilt according to traditional methods, and is open to the public for ¥300."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANI7,Japan,Kanazawa,Nagamachi Samurai District,"  Nagamachi Samurai District  (長町武家屋敷).  Towards the coast from Oyama Shrine, this is an area of a few streets where considerable effort has been expended in order to recreate the feel of the samurai housing areas. The fact that almost none of the actual samurai houses remain does little to daunt the enthusiasm of the tourists. While historically dubious, it is a pleasant area to stroll, and the one of the best of the remaining samurai districts in Japan. In Nagamachi, the  Nomura House  is open to the public (¥500), and boasts a small but exquisite garden. A short walk from there the city has relocated and restored two  ashigaru  (足軽: the lowest rank of samurai) houses that are open for free, and provide a lovely place to rest and enjoy the peace of a traditional Japanese house. Towards the Asano River to the north, there are a couple more samurai houses, not preserved or set aside as museum pieces, but actually lived in (and not open to the public)."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANI8,Japan,Kanazawa,Kazuemachi,  Kazuemachi  (主計町).  A small but very nice area of geisha houses along the riverbank　across from Higashiyama.
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANI9,Japan,Kanazawa,Higashi Chaya-gai,"  Higashi Chaya-gai  (ひがし茶屋町), across the Asano River.  Kanazawa's most famous  geisha  district.  Many of the tall narrow houses are still used as high-class entertainment, but the  Shima House  (¥400) is open for all to see, and is well worth the entry fee for a chance to experience its refined and elegant atmosphere.  Quite a few of the buildings have been converted into speciality shops and teahouses (of the non-geisha variety), so poke around freely and don't miss out on a cup of tea and a Japanese sweet (¥500-1000).  Behind this area is a temple district, and the roads between the main road and the mountain are a twisting labyrinth of narrow lanes perfect for exploring on foot. "
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANI-,Japan,Kanazawa,Nishi Chaya-gai,"  Nishi Chaya-gai  (にし茶屋町).  The ""west"" to Higashi's ""east"", this is another district of restored geisha houses.  However, this is considerably smaller (and quieter) than Higashi, with effectively just a single street, and aside from the (free) information centre it's not possible to enter any of the houses."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANI_,Japan,Kanazawa,Kanazawa Shinise Memorial Hall,"  Kanazawa Shinise Memorial Hall  (Old Merchant House). The Old Merchant House was Kanazawa's leading Chinese medicine shop in Minami-machi during the 18th century. The shop was established in 1759 and provided medicine for the feudal leaders. The merchant's family was given high status by the elders of the town. The shop was instrumental in maintaining the elegance of the tea ceremony, flower arrangement, and haiku during the time period in which it was open. The shop currently has a bridal exhibit on the second floor with examples of bridal gifts and a large flower arrangement made entirely out of sugar."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANJA,Japan,Kanazawa,Ninja Temple,"  Ninja Temple  (妙立寺  Myōryu-ji )  [9]  - The tour guides insist there is no connection between the 'Ninja Temple' and actual ninja assassins. But with 23 rooms and 29 staircases, an impressive array of trapdoors and hidden rooms, and a seppuku (ritual suicide) chamber, it is easy to see why people would make that assumption. Visitors cannot enter the temple except through the tours, so call ahead to book a tour. The tour is conducted in Japanese, but they give travellers a folder with English translations. Local lore has it that there was an underground tunnel from the castle to the temple, to allow the Maeda lords an escape route in case of attack. However, no documentary proof of this has been found, and, like the ninjas, it merely adds to the myths of the place. Unfortunately, the staff have a well-deserved reputation (amongst both Japanese and foreigners) for being rude and unhelpful.  ¥800 for adults, and you're supposed to make a reservation in advance, although they can usually squeeze you in if there's space and you don't mind waiting for your tour to begin. The hour-long tour is well worth the price."

Broadly defined, the park grounds include many of the attractions below, including the castle and the Carp's old baseball stadium (scheduled for demolition). But Chuo Park is worthy of note in its own right, with nice, long walking paths and athletic fields — there are quite a lot of open-invitation soccer, football, and ultimate frisbee games that are regularly held here, so don't be shy about showing up with athletic shoes and seeing if anyone needs an extra."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANJR,Japan,Hiroshima,Hiroshima Castle,"The original Carp ( ) Castle was built in the 1590s by Hideyoshi's warlord Terumoto Mōri, predating the city itself. It was destroyed by the atomic bomb, by which time it was serving as a military headquarters, and reconstructed in 1958. Some of the original concrete foundations can still be seen. Today, the castle grounds are a nice place for a walk, and definitely Hiroshima's favorite place for   (cherry blossom parties), with more than 350   trees. The five-story castle museum is an attractive reconstruction of the 16th century  , with interesting relics and armor to see (and try on), as well as some informative displays about the history of the castle and the city. The view from the top is worth the entrance fee all by itself."
AV_tHz0mbat9RzbdANJS,Japan,Hiroshima,Gokoku Shrine,"Located on the castle grounds, this concrete shrine has great significance to locals, having been rebuilt after the atomic blast and now the center for most annual Shinto traditions in the city.

AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANQs,Jamaica,Montego Bay,Downtown," Busy, noisy, intimidating, but refreshingly real. This is not quite what people think of as a tourist attraction. However, this is the best place to go and experience the ""real"" Jamaica. Amidst the crumbling buildings and incessant traffic, Jamaicans go about their daily lives only 1km but a world away from the glitzy resorts on the hip-strip. Here, sidewalks are almost non-existent, hawkers sell their wares next to garbage-piles and getting around is like playing an advanced level of Frogger. Nevertheless, this is the place to go and eat at a real local eatery, or buy some more authentic souvenirs. What's more, there is some seriously interesting architecture in and around the central square. Don't be too intimidated, here, people are generally more likely to be genuinely interested in you (and why you're walking around the city center) rather than try and hustle you for money. Still, it's probably best to avoid here after dark, leave unessentials behind, and to dress down...wearing shorts, sunglasses, sandals, and a tank-top will immediately scream ""Lost Tourist!"". Wear pants, shoes, and a button-shirt, and people may even ask what kind of work you do in Jamaica (seriously!), or (perhaps tongue-in-cheek)if you are Jamaican. Stick around for more than a half hour, and the intimidation wears off and you feel at one with the crowd. The most important thing to gain here is a little perspective. Come face-to-face with the harsh realities of Jamaican life, and maybe you'll have a little more respect for Jamaicans, and a little more understanding for the hustlers or the taxi drivers who keep your $20JMD change."

AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANRP,Hungary,Budapest,Hungarian crown jewels,"  Parliament  ( Országház ),  Kossuth Lajos tér ,  [1] .  The Hungarian National Parliament building is the largest in Europe, designed by architect Imre Steindl for the 1896 millennial celebrations, and built 1880-1902. It is based on England's Parliament building, and supposedly is one meter wider and longer than that august building, just a little bit of architectural conceit. The building is so immense, the weak alluvial soil along the Danube had to be reinforced with a 7-foot-deep concrete foundation. Not surprising, as the building is 300 yards long and 140 yards wide, with 691 rooms and 12.5 miles of corridors. The lacy white Gothic froth covering the building is actually educational: 88 statues representing Hungarian rulers, princes and military commanders. These statues are small and cannot be readily distinguished from the ground, but they are there.    edit  Under the Parliament's cupola the  Hungarian crown jewels  are exhibited. After World War II, the medieval crown (last used in 1916) was taken out of the country by escaping Hungarian fascists, ending up in the United States. President Carter returned the crown to the Hungarian state in 1978, accompanied by a large American delegation. It was exhibited in the National Museum until 2000 when it was moved to its present location. :The only way inside the building is with an organized tour. The tour lasts about 30 minutes. Tours only run on specific times during the day, and you have to get your ticket in advance for a timed slot. The House of Parliament's Visitor Center is directly north of the Parliament building itself and is an underground office reached by stairs. Come back at the specified time on your ticket, and a guide will appear (not in a uniform). Then you can go through security screening before starting. There is a bar/cafe just inside the main doors which is open to the public during the tour times. Tickets can be purchased in advance online (official tickets sold through Jegymester).  [58] . You can also wait in line and purchase tickets for the guided tour inside the Visitor Center. Multiple guided tours in English, Spanish, German, Italian, Hungarian, Russian, Hebrew, and French are held throughout the day. Visits to the House of Parliament are restricted during weeks in which the National Assembly holds its plenary sittings."
AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANRQ,Hungary,Budapest,Royal Palace," The  Royal Palace  ( Királyi palota ). The most popular attraction on the hill. Entrance to the area is free, while some museums and attractions have paid admission. Can be reached on foot (sloped paths and/or a long series of steps), by tourist funicular, or by public transit bus. On foot, walk to the base of the castle on the Buda side and look for the white stairs next to the palace garden park. In the park there is also a small elevator and then a small escalator that will get you part way up. By funicular, cross the chain bridge and then proceed to the base of the station. Tickets cost 1100 HUF for adults for a short ride, and the view is not particularly impressive, so this is a better option for those with limited mobility than those looking for a fun experience. By public transit bus, take bus number 16. The first known buildings here where the Royal Palace stands today, were built by Charles Robert’s eldest son, Stephan Duke of Anjou (1308-1342). It was later remodeled, but the reign of King Matthias brought about the golden age of Buda (1458-1490). Legend has it that when a Turkish ambassador came to Buda, he saw all the wealth and grandeur, forgot his greeting speech and all he could say was „The emperor sends his respects.” After several remodelings, the unique building we see today is the recreation of Alajos Hauszmann and Miklós Ybl’s1896 millennial designs. During its history the Royal Palace was destroyed and rebuilt at least 6 times. It hosted rulings but also invaders such as the Turks. Today the Palace is converted into some museums. It hosts the National Gallery. Sections of the Royal Palace include: "
AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANRR,Hungary,Budapest,Fisherman's Bastion," The  Fisherman's Bastion  and lookout terrace ( Halászbástya ). For impressive views across the Danube to Pest. This neo-Gothic construction was built in 1905 by the architect Frigyes Schulek. It is composed by seven towers that are symbolizing the seven magyar clans’ leaders that came in the Carpathian Basin at the end of the IX century. It was built between 1890-1905, and is named after both the medieval fishmarket once nearby and the Guild of Fishermen who defended this section of the wall during past wars.  The story is that different trades were responsible for defending different parts of the castle walls and that this section of the defenses was raised by the fishermen’s guild. In fact, the structure is a late 19th century fantasy built to add class to the area. That this is an invention does not detract at all from the attractiveness of the structure, nor from the impressive views of the river and Pest on the opposite side. The mounted statue between the bastion and the church is King Stephan (Istvan in Hungarian) the first king of Hungary (crowned about 1000.) He was declared a saint for his efforts in bringing Christianity to Hungary. He carries the apostolic cross with two crossbars – a symbol granted him by the Pope. In tourist season there is an admission charge of about $1 to climb on the bastion. In the daytime around the year, the bastion is the place most overcrowded by tourists in the Castle Hill, mainly brought in here by buses. The  sculpture of a Turul bird  just outside the cable car station is not, as you might think, an eagle, but the mythical turul bird (which is believed to be a kind of falcon). This bird is a part of the story of how the Magyars settled the Hungarian homeland. This bird appeared in a dream to the wife of the Magyar leader Ügyek and told her that she would be the founding mother of a new nation."
AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANRS,Hungary,Budapest,Vajdahunyad Castle,"  Vajdahunyad Castle  ( Vajdahunyad vára ).  While loosely modelled after a  Transylvanian  fortress of the same name, the building is not really a castle at all: it's a  full-scale model built for Hungary's 1896 millenial celebrations.  The structure has three distinct wings, one Gothic, one Romanesque and one Baroque, making it quite a bizarre sight when seen from a distance. But sneak up closer and its magic will be revealed: thanks to the moat, the trees and the carefully laid footpaths, you can usually only see one section at a time. The attention to detail (all copied from real sites around the country) has been painstaking, so it's like seeing three extraordinarily pretty castles rolled into one.  The structure was originally supposed to be only a temporary one, but Budapest's people liked it so much that it was rebuilt to last.  Located on an island in the middle of the park's lake. "
AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANRT,Hungary,Budapest,The Central Market Hall,  The Central Market Hall [61]  - this market is one of the most visited tourist attractions.

One section also displays selected works from the Museum of Fine Arts (Szépművészeti Múzeum) in Heroes' Square, as the Museum of Fine Arts is closed for several years for renovations.

AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANSD,Hungary,Budapest,Parliament,"The Hungarian National Parliament building is the largest in Europe, designed by architect Imre Steindl for the 1896 millennial celebrations, and built 1880-1902. It is based on England's Parliament building, and supposedly is one meter wider and longer than that august building, just a little bit of architectural conceit. The building is so immense, the weak alluvial soil along the Danube had to be reinforced with a 7-foot-deep concrete foundation. Not surprising, as the building is 300 yards long and 140 yards wide, with 691 rooms and 12.5 miles of corridors. The lacy white Gothic froth covering the building is actually educational: 88 statues representing Hungarian rulers, princes and military commanders. These statues are small and cannot be readily distinguished from the ground, but they are there."

In the basement a labyrinth of prisons was created. Many people were jailed and starved or beaten to death here. 2002, the ""house of fear"" was converted into a stylish but depressing museum about Nazi and communist terror which helps visitors to understand Hungary's 20th century.

In addition there is an exhibition of the 1956 revolution and 1989-90 political changes, a film showing about the political secret service. According to Ákos Eleőd, the architect: ""This park is about dictatorship. And at the same time, because it can be talked about, described, built, this park is about democracy. After all, only democracy is able to give the opportunity to let us think freely about dictatorship.""  Possible souvenirs are t-shirts which poke fun at communism, German Trabant car models, CDs of Hungarian communist fight songs, reproduction Hungarian Communist Party membership booklets and postcards. To attend the guided tour, or get a booklet in English is well-recommended."
AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANSI,Honduras,Tegucigalpa,Parque La Leona,"  Parque La Leona , is an old neighbourhood in the center of Tegus, overlooking the central park. It is a bit of a labyrinth to make your way up the old steep windy streets to arrive at parque La Leona, but it is a nice park, with a beautiful view, and a relaxed atmosphere. If walking, if you start facing the front door of the basilica in the central park, head to your left, and just keep walking up hill, and you will almost certainly hit the park as long as you continue upwards. Or ask someone in the area. In the park there is a little store/restaurant that sells typical Honduran food and has a patio overhanging from the park, with a spectacular view of the city, the valley, and the hills. "
AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANSJ,Honduras,Tegucigalpa,Parque el Picacho,"  Parque el Picacho , is a park overlooking the city which takes its name from the huge statue of Jesus Christ, also called ""Cristo el Picacho"", which is visible from almost any point in the city. Free parking is available at the entrance of the park, and entrance to the park is a nominal fee (around 5 USD). The views from the park are gorgeous. The park is well maintained, clean, and seemingly not very busy (though likely busier on weekends). To get to the park if you don't have a car, you can take the rapidito bus that passes the park on the way to El Hatillo. The bus leaves from a few blocks north of the central park. If you walk to the end of the Calle Peotanal that begins in front of the basilica, and follow it to the end, through the black gates, past the Museo de Identidad Nacional, all the way to the Bonillo Theatre, take a left there on the far side of the theatre, walk up one block and the bus leaves on the right. Or just ask someone in this area. On the rapidito ask the fare-taker to tell you when to get off for Picacho (about a 5-10minute walk in to the park gate, then a further 15 to the big Jesus...). The bus ride takes around 15 to 20 minutes. "

AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANSL,Hungary,Budapest,St. Stephen (István) Cathedral,"Though often called ""the Basilica"" for short due to its clerical rank as a basilica minor, it actually is shaped like a Greek cross, with two steeples and a dome on top. Designed by Miklós Ybl and József Hild, and built 1851-1905, it is as high as the Parliament building -- it's the highest church in Budapest. Walking in the main entrance, after climbing a series of stairs, the viewer is first greeted with a relief of St Stephen, then a mosaic of Christ's resurrection. There are many notable mosaics in this church, especially those within the dome designed by Károly Lotz, best known for his ceiling frescoes in the State Opera and Ethnographic Museum. While designed here, the mosaics were made in Venice. The foremost Hungarian artists of the day designed the artworks within St Stephen's, among them Bertalan Székely, Gyula Benczúr and two men also known for their work in the Opera, Mór Than and Alajos Stróbl. Here Stróbl contributed the central statue of St Stephen on the main altar. In the left hand chapel is the ""Chapel of the sacred right hand"" this is pretty surreal as St Stephen's surviving hand in a glass box, lovely.  For a fee, you can also climb to the very top of the Basilica to get a wonderful view of the city."
AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANSM,Hungary,Budapest,Great Synagogue and the Jewish Museum," This synagogue is unique both because of its size, and its two onion-shaped domes, which are forty-three meters high. Onion domes are typically found on Catholic churches, and Hungary is a very Catholic country. Perhaps Ludwig Förster, the architect, meant for it to blend in a bit. Those interested in Jewish history or culture may be interested in a guided or self-guided tour of the old Jewish Quarter of Budapest is the neighborhood bordered by Károly Boulevard, Erzsébet Boulevard, Király Street and Rákóczi Road. Main sites include Wallenberg Park, The Tree of Life, The Temple of Heroes, the Rumbach Synagogue, the Carl Lutz Memorial, and the Kazinczy Street Synagogue"

There is a separate entrance fee to enter the zoo. While not a horrible zoo, and worth seeing if you don't mind dropping a few dollars on the entrance fee, the zoo features mostly lethargic animals, the larger ones often noticeably insane as a result of their encagement. The zoo has a variety of monkeys, crocodiles, a jaguar, tapirs (anteaters), snakes, a collection of various raptors, and others."
AV_tHz0nbat9RzbdANSQ,Honduras,Tegucigalpa,Museo para la Identidad Nacional,"A very well done museum of Honduran history and art in a beautiful old colonial building.

In the following centuries the castle, which remained continuously in use until the Second World War for the defense of the city, as well as an administrative and military centre, was captured by the Franks, Venetians, Palaiologoi and Turks. The castle consists of a triangular outer enclosure reinforced with towers and bastions, which was originally protected by a deep moat and an inner enclosure rising on the NE angle and protected by a moat as well. The building phases distinguishable today on the castle provide evidence for the works carried out by each of its conquerors as repairs and provisions according to the development of military science. The original construction is visible today mainly along the north wall, but remains of it exist on all three sides of the curtain indicating that the original medieval fortification had more or less the same perimeter.

AV_tHz0obat9RzbdANTH,Greece,Athens,"Acropolis,","The  Acropolis,  a  Unesco World Heritage Site,   [51]   was the ancient fortified town of Athens, dating back to the Late Bronze Age, and the site of the best buildings of the Greek Classical age: the Parthenon, the Erectheion, the Temple of Athena Nike. Acropolis dominates the Athenian sky and symbolizes the foundation of modern culture and civilization. As the most famous landmark of entire Greece, Acropolis is the eternal symbol of democracy, education and inspiration. If you attend a university in the European Union, bring your ID and you can enter for free. The normal entrance price to the Acropolis and its slopes, including the Parthenon and the Theatre of Dionysus, is 20 euros, or 10 reduced (including non-EU students, as of May 2016--seems to be a recent price hike as much tourist literature provided in local hotels still has the old, much lower prices listed).  A 30 euro ticket (15 reduced) also gives you entry to the Kerameikos, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Roman Agora, Ancient Agora, and Hadrian's Library, as well as Aristotle's Lyceum which is a little further away next to the Byzantine and Christian Museum. Also be aware that although the Acropolis is open until 20:00 in the summer, the other sites have earlier closing times; the 30 euro ticket is good for 5 days, but does not allow reentry to a previously visited site since the stub for each site is torn off of the large ticket when you enter; not all of the other sites offer the combined ticket, so if you plan to go to all of them, you should go to the Acropolis first. If possible, get to the Acropolis early to avoid heavy crowds, and summer heat when relevant. There are two entrances, the lesser-used one starting near the new Acropolis Museum and allowing you to climb up through the Theatre of Dionysus, but this is a little bit more physically taxing as the climb can get steep.

AV_tHz0obat9RzbdANU8,Germany,Düsseldorf,Cartwheelers' Fountain," Radschläger wolle mer blieve, wie jeck et de Mensche och drieve (local dialect: we will stay cartwheelers, however crazy the world might be) is the legend of the  Cartwheelers' Fountain  at Burgplatz. It is situated under some wonderful old plane trees. The cartwheeler is a popular symbol within Düsseldorf and cartwheeling an old tradition. According to legend, after winning the War of Worringen, the Earl of Berg said to the boys waiting for their fathers, “Show me that you're happy about your fathers' return”, and they began cartwheeling. Even today this tradition is continued by annual competitions."
AV_tHz0obat9RzbdANU9,Germany,Düsseldorf,promenade," The  promenade  on the bank of Rhine is one of the most beautiful ones in Germany, and it is situated on the correct side, the right bank, because the sun shines onto this side all day long (the citizens of Cologne used to say the left bank of Rhine is the correct one because the centre of Cologne is situated there), The promenade leads from Parliament via Mannesmannufer, Rathausufer, Burgplatz, and Tonhalle to Rhine-Park. It was created by constructing a tunnel in 1993 and banning cars underground, so that the riverside became a pedestrian area. Most gangways for boat trips on Rhine are situated near to Burgplatz. Many coffee shops offer seats outside where you can watch and be watched when the weather is fine. The pavement of the promenade is an artwork too, its sinuous design reflects the waves on the river."
AV_tHz0obat9RzbdANU-,Germany,Düsseldorf,St. Lambertus Basilika,"  St. Lambertus Basilika , built with bricks in the style of Lower Rhine Gothic, is a landscape of Düsseldorf. Particularly characteristic is the winding tower. Although there are legends saying they used wet arbors for reconstructing after a fire in 1815, people know better. About 100 years ago, a bride dressed in a snow-white wedding dress came to the altar pretending to be a virgin. Being ashamed the tower turned aside. They also say that it will straighten again if a real virgin appears at the altar. As you can clearly see, the tower is still twisted. But the fact is the citizens love their twisted tower. After the war, they reconstructed it as twisted as it was before. The church-hall is last resident of St. Apollinaris, the city’s patron."

AV_tHz0obat9RzbdANVA,Germany,Düsseldorf,Neander-church," The  Neander-church  has its own history too. The population of the Rhinelands is mainly Catholic, and Protestants and members of the Reformed Church had to suffer many restricts. Finally, the contract of Rheinberg 1682 granted everybody the free practice of religion. This led to the construction of the Reformed church-house at Bolkerstrasse in 1683 in a style of the early baroque with a simplified façade. Althrough the Protestants and members of the reformed church had the right of own churches, they were not liked. So the new church had to be built in a way that is was not visible from the street, meaning in the yard of  already existing buildings. But today you have a unlimited view onto the church from Bolkerstrasse because the building before was not rebuild after the war, as the only one within the old town. In 1916, the church got the name Neander-Church."
AV_tHz0obat9RzbdANVB,Germany,Düsseldorf,City Monument," The  City Monument  at Burgplatz is an artwork of Bert Gerresheim, donated by the society “Düsseldorfer Jongens” on occasion of the 700th anniversary of town foundation. It is a  kaleidoscope of local history, starting on left side with the cruel battle of Worringen, the signing of foundation documents by the earl of Berg in the middle and several scenes on right side including 4  popes. Among them we see Nikolaus IV raising St. Lambertus Church to a canon monastery. A market scene is shown, but also trade goods of Düsseldorf. The Monument is full of symbols. You should go nearby and take account of details. You also should go some steps back. Mind the men following the apocalyptic horseriders on left side. Their arms form the number 1288, the year of the battle of Worringen. During the battle, the Earl of Berg, Adolf V, fought against the archbishop of Cologne, Sigfried of Westerburg. The citizens of Düsseldorf and, hard to understand if you know about the today's difficult relationship between the cities, the citizens of Cologne backed Adolf V. The battle ended with the victory of the earl and the citizens."

The citizens call him affectionately Jan Wellem. His monument is among the most important baroque equestrian sculptures north the Alps. Because of his connections to European dynasties and by the powers invested in him he was a very important man. In co-operation with other electors he elected the German Emperor. He was a representative of a pompous baroque sovereign. In 1691 he married Anna Maria Luisa de‘ Medici (1667-1743). Jan Wellem died in 1716, his gravesite is in St. Andreas-Church.

The museum is dedicated to the five million persons who emigrated via Hamburg. It has a computer terminal where visitors can look up information on their emigrant ancestors. At €12, it's pricey, and the English translations can be sparse and superficial. Unless they can read the German documents, American visitors who have been to museums such as Ellis Island will find much of the content familiar."
AV_tHz0obat9RzbdANV-,Germany,Bremen,Theater am Goetheplatz,"  Theater am Goetheplatz  (Theater/Opera House) this is one of the oldest buildings in Bremen and is renowned for its austere look. Under the name Schauspielhaus am Ostertor, the theatre was founded as the second establishment of the private firm Bremer Schaubühne. In so doing, the firm's directors Eduard Ichon and Johannes Wiegand, who in 1910 had opened the Schauspielhaus am Neustadtwall, widened competition with the municipal theatre, Stadttheater am Wall (now destroyed). Adapting their prices and presentations to suit all segments of the community, they were particularly successful in attracting audiences in the years following the First World War. On October 1, 1941 the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, personally visited the Theater and attended a showing of Die Valkyrie with his lover Eva Braun. However it was after the municipal theatre had suffered serious war damage during World War II, that it was decided the Schauspielhaus am Ostertor should be rebuilt as a fully-fledged three-genre establishment extending the seating from 804 to 1,111 while significantly altering the facade designed by August Abbehusen and Otto Blendermann in 1913. In keeping with the practices of the 1950s, the architects Werner Commichau and Hans Stormraising raised the height of the colonnade and eliminated the high hipped roof, successfully simplifying the facade and giving it a more austere appearance"

(Tram M10, U-Bahn Bernauer Straße U8 or S-Bahn Nordbahnhof S1, 2, or 25, follow the signs in the stations - wall is Mauer in German). Often missed by tourists but an absolute must for anyone interested in this part of the city's history.  It's a memorial to those who died crossing so you won't, fortunately, get the tackiness of the Checkpoint Charlie area; instead you will be left with a haunting feeling of what life with the wall may have been really like. The monument itself is a gigantic wasted opportunity, blank and featureless. The inscription on the outside, declaring it a monument to the victims of the ""communist reign of violence"", has sparked emotional debates and angered many local residents. The documentation center across the street on Bernauer Straße is excellent although most of the documentation is in German. The viewing platform gives you a tiny hint of the true scale of the Wall and how terrifying the ""no man's land"" between the two sections of walls must have been. When the documentation center is closed, both walls can be visited. There is some space between the concrete plates which allow you to look at the area between the walls. There are also several small holes."

In the middle ages this was the site of Hungary's most important church and had it not been for the Turks blowing it up, it would be to Hungary what Westminster Abbey is to England. The church was begun in 1016 under Hungary's first Christian king, Szent István. At the time, Székesfehérvár was the capital of the kingdom, and this church was the site of numerous coronations. In addition, from 1038 to 1543 fifteen Hungarian kings were put to eternal rest here (starting with Szent István himself and ending with Szapolyai János). As already mentioned, the church was destroyed by the Turks in 1601 and in 1800 the remains were used to build the  Bishops Palace  on nearby Városház square. Today all that remains of the once great basilica are stone walls outlining its form. The big draw, however, is to visit the mausoleum containing Szent István's sarchaphogus. This was discovered in 1803 during the building of the Bishop's Palace. The cherubic forms on the outside and royal relics contained within clearly identified this as the tomb of Szent István. The sarchaphogus originally was taken to the National Museum in Budapest, but was brought back to Székesfehérvár in 1936, and since then has remained in the attractive mausoleum at the entrance of the garden.  Photography is not allowed in the mausoleum . "

A newly restored fountain, maze of hedgerows, a revolving theatre   and a Medieval-style restaurant, Marketa beckon. At the far end of the chateau gardens, you’ll find a lush duck pond, situated in a stand of moody, gnarled trees. This is the perfect picnic spot."

[Egypt is constantly pegging their tourist attractions prices according to the rate of Euro or Dollar, therefore the entrance fee has recently been raised to 60 and 30 LE respectively. For an 8 Euros ticket, which ain't cheap, the museum is staffed by 'guards' who are chatting or listening to music inside the museum. There is not a single guide and nobody to answer you anything. Instead of, they try to put you out at 20:30 even if the museum closes at 21:00. Not a pleasant experience. (April 2015)] "

The Citadel is situated at the entrance of the eastern harbor on the eastern point of the Pharos Island. It was erected on the exact site of the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria. The lighthouse continued to function until the time of the Arab conquest, then several disasters occurred and the shape of lighthouse was changed to some extent, but it still continued to function. During the 11thcentury an earthquake destroyed the top of the lighthouse and the bottom was used as a watchtower. A small Mosque was built on the top. About 1480 A.D the place was fortified as part of the coastal defensive edifices. Later castle looking citadel was built as a prison for princes and state-man. Now it’s a Maritime Museum."

AV_tHz0qbat9RzbdANid,Egypt,Aswan,The High Dam,"Despite being a highly important piece of infrastructure, the Aswan High Dam may be a bit of a letdown. This is a typical stop among a 4-hr tour that goes to Philae and the Obelisk, which you can ask for your driver to skip."
AV_tHz0qbat9RzbdANie,Egypt,Aswan,Philae Temple,"Built to honor Isis, this was the last ancient temple built in the the classical Egyptian architectural style. Construction began in approx 690 BC. It was moved from its original location on Philae Island, to its new location on Agilkia Island, because of the flooding to create Lake Nasser. A major multinational UNESCO team relocated Philae, and a number of other temples that now dot the shores of Lake Nasser. You can see the submerged original island a short distance away, punctuated by the steel columns used in the moving process.  Note the re-use of the temple as a Christian church, with crosses carved into the older hieroglyph reliefs, and images of the Egyptian gods carefully defaced. There are grafitti dating from the 1800s.  There is a cheesy Sound and Light show at night, with English actor voices.  Scammers: Watch out for the guards who will do all in their power to get in your photos, (to get a tip), point out hieroglyphs that you can quite clearly see yourself (to get a tip), or invite you to 'pray' (against the rules), also for some baksheesh(tip)! Driver from town 40LE to 100LE with wait and return. 5LE for parking the car. After paying an entrance fee per person of 60LE, you then need to negotiate for the boat to cross to the island.  170LE is the starting price (2016)?  Locals are charged 10LE for the boat ride to the island, but the boatmen will attempt to charge you 50LE per person at least. A reasonable price should be 40-50LE per person, with wait and return included. If you are only one person, you may have to pay 100LE (2016).  The ticket booth is located at the entrance to the pier, which means you will have to buy your non-refundable ticket for the temple and have it torn by the ticket attendant *before* you can begin haggling over the price of the boat ride. It may help to wait for other travellers to show up so you can split the boat fee (if your taxi driver permits). Bargain hard. The temple is beautiful and worth seeing. "

The underground tunnels of the catacombs lie in the densely populated district of Karmouz to the east of Alexandria. The catacombs were most probably used as a private tomb, for a single wealthy family, and later converted to a public cemetery. They are composed of a ground level construction that probably served as a funerary chapel, a deep spiral stairway and three underground levels for the funerary ritual and entombment.

If you have a group of greater than 10 people, you must make a reservation in advance by calling the reservations office at +1 613 996-0896. The Centre Block tour is the most popular as it includes inside views of the House of Commons, the Senate, and the newly renovated Library of Parliament. Same-day tickets are free and available on a first-come-first-served basis from 9:00 AM.  Pick up your ticket as early as possible to have the best chance of securing a start time that works for you. Tours last from 20 to 60 minutes depending on building activity.

Macdonald, Sir George-Etienne Cartier, Governor General Lord Dufferin and the original Privy Council Office) explaining the beginnings of the Dominion of Canada while historical characters let you in on the daily lives of Canada's past politicians. Tours last about an hour and free same-day tickets can be picked up at the Info-tent on the Hill by West Block. If there are no more tickets available, or you have to wait for your time, a fine self-guided walking tour around the grounds of Parliament Hill will keep you busy.

This hotel once housed the offices of CBC Radio in Ottawa as well as the studio of well-known portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh. Several framed Karsh photographs are hung in the hotel lounge. His (and his wife's) home suite is now available for guests and displays a small sampling of framed prints on the walls. The Changing of the Guard takes place daily on the lawns of Parliament at 9:00am. The Governor General's guards can also be seen at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider and at Rideau Hall."

Many travel agencies offer day trips from Punta Arenas that leave you very little time at the colony, so it's best if you have your own car. NOTE: (1) There are fees to cross private land to enter the penguin area, and for entering the controlled area itself, and those in combination may come to more than US$10. (2) The penguins are not at this location all of the time, so you must check before making the visit.  The private property owner is now said to close access at the end of March. During part of the season, most of the penguins may be in the water and not visible, until returning to land late in the afternoon.  Check first with reliable local sources (most sources are not very reliable, however). To get to the colony, take 9 north out of Punta Arenas, head west on Y530 around the 22km. After 20km take a right at the sign for the colony. As of 1/7/15 costs were $1500 CLP per person to cross the private land and $6500 CLP per person to enter the colony. "

Unfortunately, no photos may be taken inside the museum, although photography is allowed in the central courtyard. In the middle of the courtyard is the original statue of the ""Leper King"" (actually Yama, the Hindu god of death) from the Terrace of the Leper King in  . The pleasant little park in front of the Museum is the site of the annual Royal Ploughing Ceremony, at which the success or otherwise of the coming harvest is predicted.

The built-up side of the street is home to cafés and shops and the better class of bar, and is popular with tourists and expat Westerners prepared to run its gauntlet of touts selling drugs, girls and tuk tuk rides. The esplanade along the river is also popular with Cambodians, who come here in the cool of the evening to enjoy the quasi-carnival atmosphere. It begins at the riverfront park opposite the Royal Palace, and is perhaps best experienced in the early evening.

AV_tHz0rbat9RzbdANoG,Cambodia,Phnom Penh,Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (S-21 Prison),"A school converted into Cambodia's most important prison in 1975. More than 14,000 people were tortured here before being killed here or at the Killing Fields; only 8 prisoners survived. (which is a misconception, as you will learn in the museum) The museum is easily accessible and a must-see for everyone interested in Cambodia's horrific recent past. The infamous ""skull map"" has been dismantled, although there are still skulls stacked in cabinets, implements of torture and disturbing photographs of people dying. For an introduction and further reading, try David Chandler's ""Voices from S-21"" (ISBN 0520222474). Documentary movie ""S-21"" can be purchased throughout Phnom Penh for USD1.50-2. Some of the entrance fee will go into the pocket of the museum's director, who is the son a government minister. And a warning to those who patronise the souvenir shop: don't get conned into buying a 'vintage' Rolex, Patek Philippe, Omega watch as, despite the convincing claims of the owner that they are husbands; they are fakes. Instead, opposite the museum (No 28, Street 330) is a little shop called CHA that provides inexpensive handmade goods that are made by women disabled from polio and land mines. If you ask, you will also be able to tour the shop, meeting the female workers and seeing where they study English. Admission fee is USD 3 and free for student with an ID-card (April 2015). "
AV_tHz0rbat9RzbdANoH,Cambodia,Phnom Penh,The Killing Fields of Choeung Ek,"A former Chinese cemetery, this is where the Khmer Rouge killed many thousands of their victims during their four-year reign of terror. Today the site is marked by a Buddhist stupa packed full with over 8,000 human skulls - the sides are made of glass so the visitors can see them up close. There are also pits in the area where mass graves were unearthed, with ominous scraps of clothing still to be found here and there. It is a serene yet somber place. Regularly throughout the day, a small museum screens a documentary with gruesome video images of human remains that were unearthed when the mass graves were found in 1979. Recommended to visit after learning more about the Khmer Rouge terror at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, however, like the Genocide Museum, this place is not for the squeamish. As millions were killed during the traumatic genocidal regime of Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge, as a sign of respect you should wear respectable clothing such as long trousers with sleeved shirts or tops. Flowers and incense can be bought in front of the stupa. In 2005 the memorial site was sold to a private company  . A tuk tuk to the site should cost USD9-11 return (after haggling, of course), including stopping at the Genocide Museum on the way and waiting for you at both places. Admission cost is 3 USD, although the advertised price is USD6, but that includes the (very good) audio tour, with a choice of several languages. If you don't want to do the audio tour, just say so and then you only have to pay 3 USD."

The new owners have recently renovated it and it has begun to be used once again as a venue. However, in the evenings a walk around the top perimeter is worthwhile: you can see hundreds attending exercise and dance classes, and get a view of the abandoned track below.

Legend holds it that the site was established around 1500 when a famous monk landed ashore on a piece of his sinking boat. The boat wood was carved into the oddly foreshortened reclining Buddha installed in a swimming pool like pit behind the imposing, yet despondent looking, seated Buddha in the main hall. Perhaps mimicking the construction materials origins the reclining Buddha has taken on a sunken slant at the feet end. A pair of small weather worn cannons on either side of the hall are of unknown origin but their style, an embossed crown-like seal and mysterious numbers suggest a European origin."
