This is a statue of a child urinating into a pool. Belgians have created hundreds of outfits for this statue. There are many stories of the statue's origins. It is believed to have been inspired by a child who, while in a tree, found a special way to drive away invading troops. Another story goes that a father was missing his child and made a declaration to the city that when he found him he would build a statue of him, doing whatever it was that he was doing. It has also been said a witch turned him to stone for peeing on her property. The most likely scenario is that it was the location of the market for urine, which was used for its ammonia content to tan leathers. None are definitively true. In 1747, Louis XV's soldiers stole the statue, upsetting many of the city's residents. Louis XV made it up to the city by giving the statue a medal of honor (so that he must be saluted when French soldiers pass by} and by giving him an outfit. He now gets dressed up on special occasions."}

{"name":"Atomium","city":"Brussels","country":"Belgium","intro":"Unavoidable icon of Brussels and Belgium, important place for international tourism, unique creation in the history of architecture and emblematic vestige of the World Fair in Brussels (Expo 58) the Atomium continues to embody its ideas of the future and universality, half a century later. In its cultural programme it carries on the debate of 1958: What kind of future do we want for tomorrow? Our happiness depends on what? Its recent renovation in 2006 gave its original brightness back, and the new equipment guarantees its durability. Five of the nine spheres are open to the public (so they say, but not really true). One of them is housing a permanent exhibition dedicated to Expo 58 (just some small models of some countries pavilions). Another sphere is dedicated to temporary exhibitions with scientific themes (often closed when there is no exhibition). The upper sphere offers spectacular views of the city of Brussels. When the sky is clear, the view reaches till Antwerp. There is a \"kids zone\" sphere which staff will happily direct you to even though you can never go in, it is only open to touring schoolchildren, and there is nothing inside except places for kids to sleep. In truth there are only three spheres: the top (restaurant), middle (snack bar) and bottom; the only thing to see really is the view; rather expensive at 11 \u20ac. The restaurant, also situated at the top, is open every day till 11.00 p.m. At night, the nine spheres are lit up with 2,970 lights that offer a very special show. To enrich your visit: audioguides in EN (but also in F, NL, ES, IT and RU) are available at the cash desk for 2\u20ac. Visio-guides are also available (\u20ac2) for the deaf and hard of hearing people. In August 2010, a zip-line was available from the top of the tallest sphere (102m); the \"Death Ride\" (run by former members of the Belgian Special Services) is a separate 25\u20ac, and offers a rather unique view of the insides of the Atomium and the surrounding city."}

During the Napoleonic wars the building served as a military hospital, and it was here that the great city fire of 1800 broke out (destruction of the south wing and a part of the transept). Beginning in 1811, the remaining buildings were used as the provincial prison and from 1851 until 1945 as a barracks. Between 1953 and 1963, the fortress was rebuilt and restored as the Upper Austrian Castle Museum.

{"name":"City of Joy","city":"Kolkata","country":"Bangladesh","intro":" Kolkata has been nicknamed as the  City of Joy . This comes from the numerous palatial mansions built all over the city. During the British colonial era from 1700-1912, when Calcutta was the capital of British India, it witnessed a spate of frenzied construction activity of buildings largely influenced by the conscious intermingling of Gothic, Baroque, Roman, Oriental and Islamic schools of design. Unlike many north Indian cities, whose construction stresses minimalism, the layout of much of the architectural variety in Kolkata owes its origins to European styles and tastes imported by the British and, to a much lesser extent, the Portuguese and French.  The buildings were designed, and inspired by the tastes of the English gentleman around and the aspiring Bengali Babu (literally a nouveau riche Bengali who aspired to cultivation of English etiquette, manners and custom as such practices were favourable to monetary gains from the British).  Today many of these structures are in various stages of decay. Some of the major buildings of this period are well maintained and several buildings have been declared as heritage structures. Conservation efforts are patchy and are often affected by problems of litigation, tenant troubles, ownership disputes, old tenancy laws and a lack of funds."}

The House was once the seat of the Viceroys of India; later, when the Government moved to New Delhi, it became the residence of the Governor of Bengal, a function that it fulfils to this day. While the basic features of Kedleston have been faithfully copied (the Palladian Front, the Dome etc.), Government House is a much larger, three storeyed structure. Also, the Government of India evidently did not have the funding constraints that forced the Curzons to leave their house incomplete: Government House has all four wings originally conceived for Kedleston. So today, a 'complete', brick built Kedleston, on a much grander scale, is in its acres of gardens at the heart of the Kolkata business district."}

This museum, which is housed in a 17th-century mansion, consists of three different mini-museums: colonial art, an ethnography and folk collection, and modern art.   In the Colonial Museum, most of the art dates from the 16th and 17th centuries. The museum houses paintings by the half-indigenous Melchor Perez Holguin, including his most famous work, San Juan de Dios, which has an almost perfect depiction of human hands. You'll also find a collection of beautiful antique furniture on display.  In the Ethnographic and Folkloric Museum, you can learn about local rituals and view a collection of mummified bodies that provide insight on local death rituals. Also on display is a collection of pottery from the Yampara culture. Its pottery is some of the most beautiful and technically advanced of all pre-Columbian cultures: you can see tears on the faces and evidence of ponchos. The pieces in the Modern Art Gallery reflect contemporary Bolivian artists' focus on poverty and the back-breaking labor involved in working in the mines. "}

ASUR is an acronym for Anthropologists of the Andean South, who are trying to recover the lost artesian techniques of the local population.  Located in Zona La Recoleta, this museum does an excellent job of displaying some magnificent pieces of art, mainly in the form of textiles that provide a real insight into these local cultures. For example, the Inca culture had three commandments: Don't be a thief, don't be a liar, and don't be lazy. Apparently, the indigenous people would create big intricate textiles as proof that they weren't being lazy.  In the collection from the Tarabuco culture, the artists would only weave images of what they knew: people plowing the land, dancers, and horses. In addition to this you can visit Inca Pallay-Asociaci\u00f3n de Arte Indigena. More of a shop than a museum it nevertheless has informative videos and displays on the origin of its textile products, all of which are locally made and gorgeous examples of the artisan techniques that you can actually buy and take home. Even better it operates on the principles of Fair Trade and supports the local communities in preserving their culture. In addition to viewing textiles at the Museum, you can also see artists hard at work using ancient techniques of weaving, washing, and spinning the wool. It's amazing to witness the intense work that goes into creating these unique forms of art. Descriptions are in Spanish but written guides in other languages are available.  http:\/\/www.asur.org.bo\/en\/museum\/museum"}

Although the place had lost the distinction of being a capital in 15th century, it was still the favourite summer retreat of Ottoman dynasty, featuring numerous hunting manors on the edges of the actual palace.

The oldest marathon in the world, the race started in 1897 and is always run on the holiday that commemorates Paul Revere's ride in 1775 and the ensuing battles at  Lexington  and  Concord  (suburbs of Boston) that started the Revolution. The race runs from  Hopkinton  to the finish line in Copley Square. The halfway point is the wealthy suburb of  Wellesley , where students from Wellesley College (America's leading institute for all-women's education) form the \"Scream Tunnel\" to cheer on runners (who are in turn encouraged to \"Kiss a Wellesley Girl for good luck!\"). Parts of Commonwealth Avenue outbound from there and surrounding streets are closed for the race. Elsewhere, Paul Revere's ride and the battles are re-enacted each year in front of thousands of people. Arrive early to get a good spot. Finally, the Red Sox always have a home game on this date, which starts at 11AM to accommodate the crowds who watch the Marathon as it goes by Fenway Park. This is the only Major League baseball game that starts before noon local time during the season. Other than St. Patrick's\/Evacuation Day this is the only time that you will find huge crowds at bars early in the morning."}

A host of events occur throughout the day that culminate with the Boston Pops concert on the Esplanade along the Charles river - the oldest and largest public celebration of the Fourth in the country. The concerts were started in 1929 by conductor Arthur Fiedler and were enhanced with fireworks by philanthropist David Mugar during the bicentennial celebrations in 1976. Sometimes sparsely attended in the beginning, it is televised nationally and has become the country's premier 4th of July event with hundreds of thousands squeezing along both sides of the Charles each year. This event also holds the world record for the largest crowd to ever attend a classical concert. Seats closest to the stage go to folks who show up before dawn to wait in line but there are speakers and huge TV screens posted all along the river so everybody can see the show. Parts of Storrow Drive in Boston, Memorial Drive in Cambridge, and Massachusetts Avenue on and near the Mass. Ave. bridge are closed due to extremely heavy pedestrian traffic. Note that the roads and public transit are heavily congested after the fireworks display. There are other celebrations during the day, starting with a flag-raising ceremony at City hall at 9AM. This is followed by a parade to the Granary Burial Ground which is led by the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, Boston's militia, which is the 3rd-oldest military unit in the world. Honors are given at the graves of each of the signers of the Declaration of Independence who are interred there, as well as the victims of the Boston Massacre and Peter Faneuil.

{"name":"medina","city":"Tunis","country":"Tunisia","intro":" The souq in the  medina  makes for a fascinating stroll.  Tiny shops overflowing with stuff; people selling, buying, milling about; skeletal cats lurking in the shadows; the smells of essential oils, spices, frying food and rotting garbage; the sounds of the muezzin, ra\u00ef, football on the radio, Arabic and French. The Tunis medina's main routes are labeled \"touristique\", but even a few steps off the beaten track it's a real, working market.  Behind the often scruffy facades hide old palaces, mosques, Islamic schools. Compared to  Morocco  or even  Sousse  you will not be hassled here. Bab El Bahr (The large stone-arch \"French Gate\" at the head of Avenue DeFrance) is a good starting point for the Souk. The goldsmiths are close to Bab Bnet.  Haggle  if you wish to buy anything - a quarter of the price first asked is a good starting point, except for obviously cheap items. As always, if you give a price and they agree, you will be expected to pay. The tourist office adjacent to the Clock Tower has excellent maps of the medina that depict an interesting walking tour. However, as at May 2014, apart from the mosque and one other site, most were closed for much-needed renovation and the haunts of faux guides."}

You can take a trolley from the subway station - 2 stops - or have a pleasant 15 minute walk. ).  One of the oldest and most important monasteries in Ukraine and in the territory of the former Soviet Union. Only the most important monasteries were designated as Lavras; there were only four, of which this Cave Monastery is the oldest. It was founded in 1077 by St Antoniy. The caves were dug out by priests who lived there as hermits. Nowadays, the caves are venerated by the faithful and tourists who visit the mummified monks, and pilgrims are still allowed access to the underground church there. There are two parts to the modern complex: the upper lavra, owned by the state and consisting of a number of museums (entry fee, most of them work until 18h); and the lower lavra, owned by the Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriach) and consisting of the caves (you'll need 1 UAH to buy a candle to enter). Entry is 40UAH. Do not miss the display of micro-miniatures in the upper lavra (40UAH). It sounds lame, but it is fascinating. You can enter the caves in the lower part if you dress correctly (women MUST cover their hair and wear skirts, no shorts. Expensive scarves are for sale there). Women can only just get away with pants in the winter.  Start at the Lower Lavra, visiting the caves before the crowds descend for the day (open till 16h anyway). There are two cave complexes, each housing the mummified remains of monks, as well as religous icons and other relics. Both caves are accessed through churches, with the entrance to the shorter caves at the end of a boardwalk. While it is free to enter the caves, you must purchase a taper candle for 3UAH in order to light your way. The caves are not recommended for the claustrophobic or overly tall. Once you're in there, it's hard, even impossible to turn around and go back out - you have to keep going. Some parts of the tunnels are open only to pilgrims, not tourists; sometimes these are guarded by priests but sometimes anyone can walk through. Pay 40UAH extra to visit the newly refurbished bell tower for superb 360 degree views of Kyiv. On the walk back to the Metro, stop by the very distinctive  Holodomor Memorial  and underground exhibit in the park. An entrance fee of 15UAH gets you entry; there is an English lanuage video and some computerised exhibits in English  \u00a0 edit"}

{"name":"Ak Saray Palace","city":"Shakhrisabz","country":"Uzbekistan","intro":"Ak Saray means \"white palace\". The term \"ak\" has also the meaning \"generous\", \"aristocratic\" or \"majestic\". Temur'S chronicler   reported that the world has not seen a similar building before the point of which extends from earth to the height of heaven. The palace was founded in the hours predicted by astrology. Its construction was begun in 1380 after Temur's conquest of Konye Urgench in Khorezm. Artisans from Khorezm were brought here to work on the palace and create its rich decoration. In 1396 the construction works were almost completed. The Spanish ambassador Clavigo reports that the decoration works still continued in 1404. The dimensions of the building can be perceived when looking at the gate towers: the two towers were 50 m high and had an arch with a span of 22 m. The buildings were destroyed in the 16th cent. by order of the ruler of Bukhara,  . The legend tells that Abdullah Khan was riding to Shahrizabs and saw the palace at a distance. He sent a messenger to the city as he thought that he was already near of it. The messengers nearly died of exhaustion, but the palace was still far away. The khan got angry and ordered the palace to be destoyed. The architecture of the palace is similar to Khoja Ahmed Yasavi Mausoleum in Turkestan\/Kazakhstan which was built on the orders of Temur. Archaeological excavations south of Ak Saray have revealed the rich decorated cover of the floor and rich architectural decoration consisting of majolica, marble and combination of terracotta and ornamental mosaic. Only the piles of the portals are left from Ak-Saray. The piles originally were round towers with spiral stairs inbside. Today, the towers are 38 m high. Originally, they reached a height of 50 m. The size of the palace is impressive: the main courtyard was about 120 m wide and 240 m long. Calculations from the proportions of the surviving elements let us assume that the length of the main portal was 70 m and that the towers at the corners were more than 80 m high. The 22 m wide span of the arch of the main entrance was the largest in Central Asia. The mosaic and majolica work in the niche of the portal is particularly refined. The delicate foliage ornamentation also contains calligraphic inscriptions of verses from the Quran as well as a few secular inscriptions. In the middle of the decoration an inscription gives the date of the completion 798 (1395\/1396) and the name of the craftsman   from Tabriz\/Persia. The legend tells that the architect after Temur had explained his plans started to make foundations blocks from clay mixed with gold. When Temur asked why he did that, the architect answered that he wanted to be sure that Temur was determined to construct a building that required vast expenditures. "}

{"name":"Kyiv Pechersk Lavra","city":"Kyiv","country":"Ukraine","intro":"One of the oldest and most important monasteries in Ukraine and in the territory of the former Soviet Union. Only the most important monasteries were designated as Lavras; there were only four, of which this Cave Monastery is the oldest. It was founded in 1077 by St Antoniy. The caves were dug out by priests who lived there as hermits. Nowadays, the caves are venerated by the faithful and tourists who visit the mummified monks, and pilgrims are still allowed access to the underground church there. There are two parts to the modern complex: the upper lavra, owned by the state and consisting of a number of museums (entry fee, most of them work until 18h); and the lower lavra, owned by the Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriach) and consisting of the caves (you'll need 1 UAH to buy a candle to enter). Entry is 40UAH. Do not miss the display of micro-miniatures in the upper lavra (40UAH). It sounds lame, but it is fascinating. You can enter the caves in the lower part if you dress correctly (women MUST cover their hair and wear skirts, no shorts. Expensive scarves are for sale there). Women can only just get away with pants in the winter.  Start at the Lower Lavra, visiting the caves before the crowds descend for the day (open till 16h anyway). There are two cave complexes, each housing the mummified remains of monks, as well as religous icons and other relics. Both caves are accessed through churches, with the entrance to the shorter caves at the end of a boardwalk. While it is free to enter the caves, you must purchase a taper candle for 3UAH in order to light your way. The caves are not recommended for the claustrophobic or overly tall. Once you're in there, it's hard, even impossible to turn around and go back out - you have to keep going. Some parts of the tunnels are open only to pilgrims, not tourists; sometimes these are guarded by priests but sometimes anyone can walk through. Pay 40UAH extra to visit the newly refurbished bell tower for superb 360 degree views of Kyiv. On the walk back to the Metro, stop by the very distinctive   and underground exhibit in the park. An entrance fee of 15UAH gets you entry; there is an English lanuage video and some computerised exhibits in English"}

Originally, the mausoleum was intended for the grave of Ismail Samani\u2019s father,  , but later became the burial vault of the Samanids. It was completed in 905 and is the oldest Muslim monument in Bukhara. It is considered as a masterpiece of early Islamic architecture.    was born in 234\/849 and died in 295\/907. He was the first member of the Samanid dynasty ruling over all Transoxania and Fargana. He was governor of Bukhara on behalf of his brother  . Ismail had defend Bukhara against attacks by Khwarazmian forces. He twice failed to send the 500,000 dirhams annual tribute to Nasr and had to defend the city against two attacks by Nasr. After Nasr's death in 279\/892 Ismail became ruler of all Transoxania. He transfered the capital to Bukhara and was recognized as governor by caliph   (279-89\/892-902). In 280\/893 he led an expedition north into the steppes, capturing \u1e6caraz (modern Dzhambul\/Kazakhstan), taking an immense booty of animals and Turkish slaves, and converting a Nestorian Christian church into a mosque. Ismail's greatest achievement was the defeat of   in a battle near Balk in 287\/900. Amr had received from caliph al-Mo\u02bfta\u017ced eastern Persia and Transoxania, which entailed deposing Ismail as governor. Amr invaded the upper Oxus (Amu Darya) provinces, but was decisively defeated by Esma\u02bf\u012bl. The \u02bfAbbasids at Baghdad were thus relieved of pressure from the aggressive Saffarids, and the caliph formally appointed Ismail governor of Khorasan, Sistan, Ray, \u1e6cabarestan, and Isfahan, in addition to his Transoxanian provinces. Samanid amirs were, however, able to retain permanent control of Khorasan and Transoxania only. Although he still officially recognized the caliphs\u2019 overlordship in the Friday sermon and on his coins), Ismail took advantage of his distance from Iraq and his new prestige to function as an independent sovereign. There is no evidence that he ever forwarded regular tribute or taxation to Baghdad. He spent his last years witgh battles against the Zaydi Shiite imams in the Caspian provinces, extending Samanid power westward across northern Persia, and repelling a Turkish invasion from the steppes. Ismail launched an offensive against \u1e6cabarestan and northern Persia and by 287\/900 held territory as far west as Ray and Qazvin, though again his successors were not able to hold on to these areas. When Ismail died he was succeeded by his son Ahmad (295-301\/907-14). Ismalil became renowned for justice and piety and for serving the caliph and his interests faithfully and is considered as the greatest of the Samanids. "}

The  red sand dunes  that visitors visit are about 50ha (1\/2km\u00b2) of open sand on a hillside with ten-meter undulations, staffed by dusty children with plastic slides who will offer instruction and assistance if you want to slide on the sand. Be careful of these children as they will offer to carry your bag for you as you go sliding, then steal your phone or wallet. There are so many boys that you won't be able to tell who did it. The dunes also offer nice views of the coast to the north. In all, it's worth a half-hour visit, especially if you have rented your own motorbike for the day. On the opposite side of the road are a series of small cafes where you can park your motorbike for a small fee if you ride there on your own. Most day tours sold by local tour operators include a stop at the dunes.

For the most part, the stream is about ankle-deep and no more than knee-deep even at its deepest. It is sandy with few stones and can be walked comfortably barefooted. You can climb up the red sand hills overlooking the river valley and even walk there parallel to the river, however, the sand may be hot on a sunny day, so bring some footwear. Walking upstream for about 20 minutes, you will reach a small waterfall into at most waist-deep water, great to take a refreshing bath before heading back! To reach the stream from Ham Tien market, pass the intersection of the road heading up to the four lanes divided highway. At this point, the name of the road changes from Nguyen Dinh Chieu to Huynh Thuc Khang. Continue east until you cross a small bridge. Coming from Mui Ne, the bridge is about two kilometers west of the town. The stream is underneath, you will see a sign pointing towards a path to the left, go that way to reach an easy place to enter the stream.

The ruins themselves, such as nearby My Son, now tend to be crumbling piles of bricks and somewhat disappointing, giving little sense of the spectacular artwork produced by the Cham civilization.

Several Buddhist temples have been built into the caves and grottoes, and it's a popular pilgrimage site.

Either way, bring walking or climbing shoes. Please note that exploring all five mountains might be ambitious for a single day's touring and would probably require quite a few hours. For those who would rather just visit one because of limitations on time or energy, go to Thuy Son which is the largest of all of the mountains with the most features to explore (including the aforementioned Am Phu cave).

It is great for historians of contemporary Tajikistan and the current President, but only if they speak Russian or Tajik, as there are very few English signs. The museum is very poorly funded (there is a man who follows you to turn off the lights after you are finished with an exhibit room) but charming and contains a number of interesting artifacts highlighting the syncretistic character of Tajik culture throughout the millennia. The huge (14m long) statue of a reclining Buddha on the second floor validates a visit on its own merits. The Museum of Ethnography, which displays traditional Tajik dress and costume, is next door costs less and is certainly worth a visit."}

{"name":"Cath\u00e9drale St-Pierre","city":"Geneva","country":"Switzerland","intro":"The new Espace Saint Pierre pass includes entrance to all three sites of Cour Saint-Pierre, a noteworthy space of unique spiritual and cultural importance. The  Cathedral and its towers, originally Catholic, both embody the high point of the Reformed tradition and explore the origins of Christianity with an extensive archaeological site and they are now complemented by the International Museum of the Reformation on the ground floor of the Maison Mallet. An underground passage, reopened when the Museum was created, connects the two buildings.  The  archeological tour   beneath the cathedral is excellent for those interested in such material and it explains the origins not only of the cathedral but the reason for Geneva's location back to pre-Roman times. Those willing to climb the steps of the Cathedral's towers will be rewarded with magnificent views of Geneva and the lake. Nearby, the Auditoire, where Calvin taught, completes a complex that is both representative of the past and open to current questions. The new Espace Saint-Pierre thus aims to contribute to our understanding of today\u2019s world \u2013 between tradition and modernity, cultural experimentation and spiritual practice. These three buildings invite the visitor to explore the city\u2019s history. Religious denominations aside, Espace Saint Pierre represents a spirit that continues to guide the city and citizens of Geneva today.

{"name":"Taipei 101","city":"Taipei","country":"Taiwan","intro":"  Taipei 101  (\u81fa\u5317 101)  [25] . Officially known as the Taipei International Financial Center (\u81fa\u5317\u570b\u969b\u91d1\u878d\u5927\u6a13), this 101-floor, 508-meter high skyscraper is in the Xinyi District of Taipei and is the ninth tallest skyscraper in the world. The tower is rich in symbolism; it was designed to resemble bamboo rising from the earth, a plant recognized in Asian cultures for its fast growth and flexibility, both of which are ideal characteristics for a financial building. The building is also divided into eight distinct sections, with eight being a number associated with prosperity in Chinese culture. The internal architecture of Taipei 101 is similarly awe-inspiring. Pay attention to ornate details on the structural beams, columns, and other elements. Taipei 101 is perhaps most notable for its feats of engineering. It was the world's tallest building from 2004 to 2010, as determined by three of the four standards designated by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. It also boasts the world's second fastest elevators, which will zip visitors up to the 89th-floor observation deck in a mere 37 seconds (cost: NT$500. NT$450 for students\/Youth Card Holders etc., NT$400 for kids under 12 \u2013 NT$1,000 fast track). It's worth taking a ride up, as the views are stunning. It opens 10am - 10pm daily. The best time to visit would be in the late afternoon when you spend a couple of hours and see both day and night views of Taipei (others recommend noon time for it appears less crowded as tour groups have lunch). You can also go up to the outdoor observatory on the 91st floor (note that while it's possible to go to the outdoor observatory in a wheelchair, the view is negligible, as the concrete railing is too high to see over). Don't forget to look toward the middle of the building, where you'll see the world's largest spherical tuned mass damper (one of three) that keep the building steady. Attached to the tower is a large, up-scale mall. While the stores are unremarkable in that they offer the same brand-names as stores in other major cities around the world, the open and spacious design of the structure itself definitely makes it worth a visit. A supermarket specializing in imported food items is located in the basement. (See also the \"shopping\" section for more on the mall). Taipei 101 is a 15 to 20-minute walk from the Taipei City Hall MRT station (Blue Line) but is best reachable by the World Trade Center stop (Red Line)."}

These mineral deposits provide a grippy surface for hands and feet, allowing one to travel UP a waterfall with relative ease. Very likely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and an absolute must see. Key notes: More powerful in the rainy season (June through September). A popular destination for Thai families on the weekends, so the area will be busier during this time. Some travelers have had a problem seeing the sign leading off of the main road down to the waterfalls; along the way there is a sign stating \"Bua Tong 18km\".

He is also very knowledgeable about anything related to 'Soviet' culture. Entering the museum is like going through a time-machine back to the USSR. Rustem has managed to acquire anything and everything from the \"Soviet\" period. He is also bubbling with stories and anecdotes of how \"then\" compares to \"now\". Drop by on Sunday afternoons for impromptu Soviet songs jam sessions, complete with guitars, bass, drums, tambourines, bongos, flutes, fog machines and strobe lights. This place is too fun to be named a museum and is interactive in the fullest sense. Well worth the price. A must see if you're in, or anywhere near, Kazan."}

The communist ideal revolved around self sufficiency, so everything (except for oil and the like) that needed to be used in Iasi was made in Iasi. The city's outskirts are dominated by an immense industrial zone, in which more than 90 percent of the factories have become abandoned. When the communist regime fell, these factories closed one by one, succumbing to foreign competition and internal political chaos. What is left are hundreds of factories, buildings, warehouses and fields which are completely abandoned, overrun with shrubbery, begging for exploration.  It is unique, amazing and wild, and will not last long. With the European Union's accelerating economic involvement in Romania and the increasing price of land in the city, the industrial wasteland will soon be cleaned up and taken under control by the overzealous and bored Romanian policemen. You can get there by asking which way is the \"zona industriala\". If you are in \"Podu Ros\" walk towards \"Tesatura\" , away from downtown. As you walk you will pass the electrical power plant. You can also take tram number 1 from Podu Ros and get off at the very end (make sure it's NOT going towards Copou). At the end of the tram line, walk around, because you have entered the largest communist wasteland around Iasi. There are other abandoned factories, but this is the largest concentration. Another extremely large abandoned factory is C.U.G., and used to produce large industrial equipment. It is at the end of bus lines 9 and 41, next to \"Frumoasa\". If you take the train to come into Iasi, you'll probably go by this factory for a very long time. C.U.G. is not completely abandoned, so you should be careful, but it also probably has the most impressive warehouses and heavy machinery. Try to imagine how 30 years ago these places were the workplaces of most of the inhabitants of Iasi. Many people moved from the countryside to the city to work in these factories. "}

Tourists are charged inflated entry rates of up to 40 soles per person, to see some animals that are often malnourished and sick, and kept under horrible conditions. As these places pay handsome kick-backs to boat owners who bring them tourists, it occurs regularly that tourists who hire a boat to take them to Pilpintuwasi, Monkey Island, or the Caiman Farm, are actually dropped off at one of the serpentarios.

During the period of Durrani rule, however, the fort once again assumed its importance. Maharaja Gulab Singh and Rambir Singh, the Dogra rulers, reconstructed and extended the fort for their political and military operations. Towards the middle of 1947, the Dogra forces left, leaving the fort abandoned. The architecture of the fort shows that great experts in design and structure participated in its construction. It is surrounded on three sides by the Neelum River formerly known as the Kishenganga River. The northern part of the fort had terraces with steps leading to the bank of the river. The eastern side was very well protected from the hazards of flood waters, but some parts on the north side have suffered damage.

The oldest surviving buildings are from the mid 13th century, but the area was a royal residence from the late 11th century. The fortress is situated close to the international ferry terminal. The royal hall, H\u00e5konshallen, (Haakon's Hall), named for King Haakon Haakonsson, was built some time between 1247 and 1261. It is used today for royal galas, as a banqueting hall for the city council, and other public events. The roof is reconstructed after a blast during World War II. The nearby Rosenkrantz tower has the same appearance as it had in the 16th century. The oldest part of the tower dates back to the 1270s, a few decades after H\u00e5konshallen. It was expanded in the 1560s by the governor, Erik Rosenkrantz, to its present shape. The rest of the medieval buildings in the fortress have been replaced or demolished over the centuries, with some ruins still visible. Among these is the medieval cathedral, the Church of Christ, which was used for coronation and as a royal burial site in the 13th century. A memorial marks the site of the high altar. Guided tours of the royal hall and the tower start every hour between 10AM and 4PM every day from 15 May to 31 Aug in the royal hall. From 1 Sept to 14 May tours are only available between noon and 3PM on Sundays. Entrance fee is kr. 60 for adults, 30 for students and free for children under 16. A small cafeteria with coffee, tea and basic snacks is open from June to August. The fortress grounds serve as a city park; you can hang out here and eat that fish you just bought at the nearby fish market - or just enjoy the sunshine and the view. The park is popular among locals and tourists, but usually not crowded. It is normally not a problem to find a good spot for your picnic or a round of Frisbee. There is a very good view of the bay. The use of open fire, including barbecues, and the drinking of alcoholic beverages are forbidden. Unlike in many other parks, the prohibition of alcohol is enforced strictly here, as the fort is still a military area with occasional military guards on patrol."}

Unlike most markets, there is life at here every day of the week, but to really see the orchestrated chaos as the commerce spills out into the surrounding area in all its glory, you should go during the market days, Monday and Friday. The chief attraction of the market is probably the spectacle of the thing; it's the place the locals go to do their shopping, so you won't see much that you would want to buy (though you'll encounter lots of people who would be delighted to sell it to you). One good exception is a corner with a few merchants who sell traditional charms and magic remedies(ask somebody for  magani  or  medicament traditionel ); you can get several types of magic charms and traditional jewelry from them, not to mention miles and miles of beads. These are typically extremely cheap and are a great chance to practice your bargaining skills without being out a ton of money, although many of the merchants don't speak French. While you're there, also take a moment to note the collections of traditional medicines and remedies. If you're planning on brushing up on your sorcery, you can find among the piles of herbs and plants things like hedgehog quills, chameleon tails, and even dried monkey heads. They might make fantastic gag gifts, but be forewarned that they are more expensive than you'd guess and that you can legally bring almost none of it back into the US or most European countries. "}

However, rumor has it that he likes meeting foreigners, so you might be able to charm your way in to watch him hold court, or for a tour or a private audience. A gift (money, or a more traditional gift like kola nuts) might grease the wheels. Even if you get in, expect to be shown to a comfortable chair and be kept waiting for some time (this is likely even if you make an appointment); you should seriously consider finding somebody to give you a primer on the etiquette for encountering a Hausa traditional chief before you try to go.

The selection at the store is less diverse than what is found elsewhere, perhaps because Maradi is neither a Tuareg city nor a place frequented by tourists, but the prices are more reasonable (although the arrangement where every artisan's wares are sold in the same store makes the prices far less negotiable than it might be elsewhere). The prices are certainly more reasonable than they are at the Guest House, the only other place in Maradi that the author is aware of where you can reliably buy pieces of world-famous Tuareg silver jewelry. If you're going to go, though, don't just go to buy stuff. Take the time to go around and watch the artisans working; a lot of their work is fascinating to watch, and they are a very friendly, talkative bunch. If you are invited in for tea, feel free to accept or decline; if you accept, be aware that you will be signing up for one of the strongest caffeine kicks you can get and that it is considered rude to leave before you've had three cups. While you're there, wander across the street and have a look at the Grande Mosque; it isn't the same spectacle as Niamey's or even Tibiri's (see below), but it's worth a visit. "}

Opened in 1999 atop a hill just south of Phewa Tal, the Stupa is the first Peace Pagoda to be constructed in Nepal and offers great views of the Annapurna Mountains, including Fishtail, Dhaulagiri, Annapurna South, and Annapurna III. This is a great place to watch the sunrise or sunset over Pokhara. Tushita Nepal Meditation Retreats is just nearby. Indeed, it is the school of life. May you go there for engineering life and get the key for happiness and peace. www.tushitanepal.com. The easiest way to get there is to take a taxi to the base of the Peace Pagoda (NPR1000 return, including waiting). If you want to go on foot, you must first get to the southern side of Phewa Tal, either by walking around the lake or rowing across the lake. Then take a very steep hike (no switchbacks!) through the forest (watch out for leeches during the monsoon) or from the road that passes Devi's Fall, turning right at the end of Chhorepatan. To hike to the top: From the small fork road behind the bakery in Damside, go south 200m, past a few hotels to the road bridge over the big canal. Go southwest along smaller road to the cable bridge over the creek, notice the \"peace\" sign on bridge anchor cement. Cross, then go up steps to rite, hence main walking trail to left along rice fields. 200m to a small temple and water tap. Notice another peace sign and arrows pointing zig zag up behind tap. Follow the zig zag trail through the forest to steps and continue up them to the top of the ridge spur, follow the USA style tree \"blazes\" (notches in the tree trunks) wherever things get confusing. Follow the large trail through lovely forest with monkeys at times. Warning: there have been reports of a few robberies. Reach forested ridge top at a mudhole\/saddle, hence trail crosses over to north side, through more nice forest. Look for tree markers. gradually up until you reach open main ridge, within sight of Peace Pagoda. A few small cafes and a hotel here, then steps up to top. It should take around 35min from the hotels near the road bridge over the big canal."}

Head up Sarankot in the late afternoon (be prepared, it's steep and hard work) find yourselves a warm guest house before sunset, go up the top for sunset and again for sunrise... you won't be disappointed. You can rent a motor bike for under NPR700 and take yourself to the top. The road is rough, but traversable. Great views, spectacular images and a great way to get a taste of what it's like to be trekking.\n Sarangkot south-slope trail . This is a somewhat demanding trail up Sarangkot Hill. To access it, go north through Lakeside through Kahare, and follow the road as it turns westward around the corner of the lake, toward Sedi Bogar village. Turn right at Caravan Restaurant. Follow the stone road (too rocky for a car or bike) 1 km directly north towards Sarankot's forested slopes, past some houses, to a school. The road ends to the right (east) of the school; follow the trail behind, east (right), which leads into a seasonal creek gully. 100m up this trail, before crossing the gully, the trail up to Sarangkot branches off to the left and soon the stone steps begin. (The start of the trail is a little hard to find; ask a local near the school if necessary.) Follow the steps all the way through a lot of jungle, follow the arrows carved into stones where confusing, cross the 4x4 road 3 times but stay on the stone steps, pass through some small villages until the steps finally end at a paved road with some restaurants and a school nearby. This is about 80% of the way up. From here the parasail jump-off is down the road a bit, 200m to the right; to get to Sarangkot, go left instead. Follow the road for a few hundred meters toward the final slope with the steps leading up easily visible by their railings. At the top of the steps is Sanrangkot village; there are a nummber of hotels, cafes, shops, and restaurants here, and the cement path leading up to the top is obvious. Morning views are best. The admission fee for the viewpoint on the summit is 50 rupees for foreigners, 20 for SAARC countries. At a regular hiking pace this trail takes about 90 minutes from the bottom at Caravan restaurant. Coming down the same way isn't much faster: the trail is too slippery and narrow to descend fast, and it's hard on the knees. Taking a taxi down the main road is an alternative, or possibly hitching a ride in a parasail truck going down."}

{"name":"Natural History Museum (closed indefinitely)","city":"Ulaanbaatar","country":"Mongolia","intro":"When the first national museum was established in Mongolia in 1924, the natural historical museum was founded, consisting of the choicest exhibitions of Mongolian nature. Since the national central museum was put into its present location in 1956, it has been enriching its exhibitions and expanding as a big natural department, which has various kinds of geographical, flora, fauna and paleontology exhibits. The government resolution to classify the museums in different fields, as in developed countries, was passed and the national central museum was abolished in 1991. In 1992, a new museum was established in the place of the national central museum with the purpose of being the lead natural central museum for further development, entertaining foreigners on the international level, showing the geological history such as locations of planets and earth establishment and formations and show the biological characteristics of earth's central zone and named as Museum of Natural History. Natural history involves the historical process of 4.7 billion years  from the origin of the world until the origin of plants, animals and humans. Thus the museum shows the briefness of these events by exhibitions and contributes knowledge to people's minds. Museum colleagues always enrich their treasures and exhibitions, renovate the exhibition halls and improve the museum arrangement so that the museum has become a big museum, which is capable of attracting foreign and domestic visitors. The museum is one of the largest museums in Mongolia, with 40 halls with 2,700 square meters and 12,000 exhibits.

Enjoy the shows, but be prepared to give some dirhams to watch. By day it is largely filled with snake charmers and people with monkeys, as well as some of the more common stalls. Ignore anyone who offers you something that you do not want or move away: They will be asking you shortly for (too much) money.

While not spectacular like the Shwedagon, the river-front setting and the hollow stupa make it worth visiting."}

There is also a boardwalk around the southern edge of the lake, affording a better view than that from the gardens. However the entry fee for the boardwalk alone is 2000 kyats or $US2. It is cheaper to walk along the road footpath (sidewalk) with free view from the outside looking through the fenced park. Caution: If intending to go to the boardwalk, be careful where you are entering because a wrong entry means money down the drain that should have been allotted to a more noble purpose such as donating to a beggar. To go to the lake itself, you have to be ready to cough out the amount stated above to be paid at the entrance located in the middle of the south side road. But if your real intention is to get close to the Karaweik, the entrance is on the southeast corner and there is a separate charge. The charge to the Karaweik is 300 kyats. The lake is separated from the Karaweik by a fence and there is no way of simply crossing over although the view from the street outside looks like they are all integrated."}

There are many Hausa-styled pavilions containing displays on Nigerien history & customs and exhibitions focusing on such things as traditional instruments, paleontology\/archaeology, costumes, & uranium mining. The national zoo is depressing, mostly sahelian animals. Other sites on the campus include traditionally-built dwellings, a small bar, and many handicrafts sellers. Bring water or buy it outside, as it is expensive inside. The exhibits and boutiques are closed in the afternoon from 12:00-15:00h though during that time you can still see the animals and artisans. Entry costs 1000F, a photography permit is 1000F, & a guided tour(in French) costs 2500F. There are two entrances: one on Rue du Musee and another opposite the Palais du Congres."}

The Azure Window is a cliff outcropping with a hole in the middle. The Inland Sea is a typically Maltese name in that it slightly exaggerates its size (Mdina is referred to as a city with its 400 inhabitants). It's actually a small lake connected to the sea by a tunnel about 100 meters long through the cliffs. In contrast to Xlendi and Marsalforn this place has been spared from development and makes an unusual and picturesque place to swim. The beach surrounding the lake is unfortunately made of pebbles but there are a few piers and terraces in front of the fishermen's boathouses one can also use. The Blue Hole is not a true blue hole in the geological sense but still makes an amazing spot to dive, having won awards as one of the most beautiful diving spots of Europe. Unfortunately, on Wednesday 8th March, 2017, the Azure Window collapsed after its outer column crumbled down as a result of typical gale winds and strong waves at this time of the year, natural processes which have and are still continuously eroding the coast, mainly on this side (west coast) of the islands.

{"name":"Alms ceremony","city":"Luang Prabang","country":"Laos","intro":"  Alms ceremony  \u2014 monks at dawn (05:30) collecting alms of rice from kneeling villagers and tourists, who form the majority, along Sakkaline Road near Wat Sensoukharam. Just look for the long row of rice baskets and stools that have been laid out for tourists who have paid for the privilege of giving alms. Seeing these tourists, who make up the majority of the alms-givers, seated on plastic stools participating out of fun rather than sincerity definitely reduces the authenticity of the moment. To make things worse, some are dressed inappropriately: please, if you want to give alms, at least cover up and do not show the monks your cleavage. If you are white, please keep a distance from the monks so people can take authentic photos without a European backpacker getting in the way. Ask your guest house host to assist you the day before in preparing if you'd like to get up and give alms in the morning. Please note that the alms giving ceremony is one which, while picturesque, is not without its detractors. Unscrupulous local merchants have used the eagerness of tourists to participate in a local tradition as a means of making easy money, and sometimes sell unsuitable, stale and even unsafe food. This has resulted in monks falling ill after having consumed the offerings, and resistance to continuing the tradition. However, the government has made it clear that the monks have to continue the tourist pageant or risk being replaced with lay people clothed in saffron robes in order to keep up appearances, and thereby maintain tourist revenue. So if you wish to participate in this ceremony, prepare the food or fruit yourself, and avoid giving food of unknown quality. Another problem is the photography: while it looks nice on your collection, think about how it must feel for the monks to have hundreds of tourists photographing them every day. Some lowlifes even stand right next to them, flashing them in the eyes. Strongly consider only watching this old tradition from a distance instead of using it as a tourist attraction, as this may detract from the beauty of the ritual - both for locals and tourists alike. You can always download a picture of it somewhere on the net for your collection."}

{"name":"Kuang Si Falls","city":"Luang Prabang","country":"Laos","intro":"A large multi-stage waterfall, accessible by boat or truck hire, some 29\u00a0km south of Luang Prabang. You can rent a motorbike to transport yourself there. Parking your bike at the entrance costs 2000 kip. There are food and tourist stalls outside the waterfalls. It is worth putting a whole day or more aside for seeing this because it is a great place to relax and meet others. There are multiple pools at different levels, all of which are reportedly safe to bathe in, and are extremely picturesque. Shared tuk-tuks to go there charge about 30 to 50,000 kip. The cheapest seems to be near slow boat pier, though you can get them for 40,000 kip near JoMa Bakery. You may have to wait until the tuk-tuk fills up. Tuk-tuks are legally only allowed to take six people, and there is a checkpoint at the falls, so some drivers may try to get a 7th person in the front seat. A private tuk-tuk will cost you around 150,000 kip after some haggling. Drivers will try to show you some documents that quote 200,000 kip or more. Ignore it and insist on your price. Try and go with 5 people and insist on 30,000 kip each. Drivers should wait for 3-4 hours for you at the waterfall gate area. Make sure your 150,000 kip includes transport there and back. Bargain, bargain, bargain. Just remember that there are dozens of tuk-tuks around, so you have the advantage. If on your own, propose 30,000 kip, and if you have the patience wait until he finds more people. A seat in a mini bus costs 40,000 kip, more if booked through travel agent. Be careful of leeches in the water, especially if you climb to the top of the top of the falls. There is a lot of leeches in the water."}

Alternatively, you can hire canoes and a guide for the day, which will allow you to view the beautiful scenery and visit the caves without throngs of other tourists. It's also possible to finish the trip at the \"whisky village\" where the local Laolao rice spirit is made. Those caves were used as a storage unit to keep the damaged Buddha statues (it is considered bad luck to throw them away, so they are often stored in caves) and were made a tourist attraction; if you ever been to any cave before, it is not worth a dedicated visit as you're likely to be disappointed. There are two caves: one on the entry level and another, the upper caves, on top of the hill, a very steep climb. A torch is recommended to see the upper cave, and will be given on entrance. Ticket for a round boat tour to Pak Ou Caves (with stop at the whisky village) costs 65,000 kip (Jan. 2015) per person and can be purchased at the pier (first boat takes off at 08:30 but the ticket office is open at 8). If you book a \"half-day tour Pak Ou\" at the local tourist office, make sure if the entrance fee is included in the price, or the whole \"service\" to be provided is just selling you a boat ticket with surcharge; in the latter case, just go to the pier (at Mekong river, easy to find) and buy the tickets yourself. Simply cross the river for for 3,000-5,000 kip, walk up the hill and turn to the right crossing the primary schools to find your way to the caves."}

{"name":"Buddha Park","city":"Vientiane","country":"Laos","intro":"  Buddha Park  ( Xieng Khuan ) is a bizarre outdoor collection of huge concrete sculptures of Buddhist and Hindu deities, and real and imaginary beasts. The reclining Buddha is especially impressive. Built in 1958 by mystic Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat, who left the country after the communist take-over, and in 1978 established a similar but more impressive park ( Sala Keoku  or  Sala Kaew Ku ) across the river in  Nong Khai ,  Thailand . Located 24 km from the city, it's about 6 km to the east of the Friendship Bridge - hence it's well worth visiting on the way into or out of Laos if you're crossing the Friendship Bridge, as this will save a 48 km round trip if you visit from and return to Vientiane. The Buddha Park entrance fee is 5,000LAK. There is technically a 3,000LAK camera fee, but officials weren't interested in collecting this fee (as of Feb 2016)."}

{"name":"Lao National Museum","city":"Vientiane","country":"Laos","intro":"Formerly the Lao Revolutionary Museum by name, the historical exhibits on the first floor are modest though very interesting in depicting some of the early history. They include one of the original Jars from the Plain of Jars and various stone and bronze age implements. The second floor provides us with a great insight into the 18th Century Laotian Kingdom and the customs of the day. It would appear that the Loatians didn't treat their guests quite as well in those days, often keeping them from leaving the country for several months. The floor builds up to a fervently revolutionary pitch as it documents the heroic struggle of the Lao against the Siamese (Thai), French and American imperialists. Exhibits include items such as socks worn by Politburo members when they escaped from prison and Kaysone Phomvihane's chest expander. The final rooms, on post-revolutionary Laos, are mostly a photo gallery of pressing topics such as the comrades of the 7th Plenary Session of the Laos People's Congress inspecting fertilizer production processes. The final rooms provide an insight into some of the modern advancements, though these are fairly dowdy and uninspiring. A guestbook regularly features amusing arguments between young western visitors on the subject of communism. Most exhibits are labelled in English, though some French labelling remains, occasionally to the exclusion of English."}

The Ipoh railway station was initially meant to be a hospital and used before the 1900s as such before being turned into a station. The original completion year of 1917 was delayed for three years due to lack of construction materials as well as high costs during World War I.  Like the Kuala Lumpur station, the Ipoh station was designed and constructed by Arthur Benison Hubback, a British architectural assistant to the Director of Public Works. Having served in India, Hubback utilized his knowledge of Anglo-Asian architecture in the region on the station's design. The \"Neo-Moorish\/Mughal\/Indo-Saracenic\/Neo-Saracenic\" style was not uncommon at the time.  Many of Hubback's buildings in then Malaya followed this style and shared many similar features. The other buildings designed by him include the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station (completed 1910), the Jamek Mosque (completed 1909) and the old KL city hall building (completed 1904).

Tin dredges work by scooping up bucket loads of tin-bearing soil at the front end, which then passes through an oscillating drum and a system of jigs and screens to extract the tin, before spewing out the waste material at the rear end through a number of chutes.  This dredge was built for the Southern Malayan Tin Dredging Ltd, a company formed in 1926 which operated a further 5 dredges in the Batu Gajah and Tanjung Tualang area. TT5 was in operation for 44 years until 1982 by which time the Malaysian tin industry was in rapid decline due to a combination of exhausted tin deposits, low tin prices, and high operating costs.

Swami Vivekananda on his return from the west was requested by the devotees in Madras (now Chennai) to start a Math here. To fulfill their desire Swamiji sent his brother-disciple Swami Ramakrishnananda to Madras in March 1897. After reaching Madras, the first thing Swami Ramakrishnananda did was to set up a small shrine for Sri Ramakrishna at a rented house. He lived there and led a life of renunciation, service and austerities. Slowly he built up the institution as the present Sri Ramakrishna Math and thus Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras, came into existence.  This is the oldest centre of the Ramakrishna Order in the South. Srimat Swami Bhuteshanandaji Maharaj, the 12th President of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, laid the foundation-stone for this Universal Temple on 1 December 1994 in a grand function.

This is the first English church in India and the oldest Anglican church in the East.Designed by William Dixon, the then Master Gunner of the Fort, it was constructed under the supervision of the Governor Streynsham Master. Given the precarious nature of the English presence in India at the time (not to mention later attacks by the French and the locals), the church has a defensive stance- thick walls, castellated parapets and a well within the grounds - to withstand any bombardment or siege). The church was consecrated on 28 October 1680. The tower was completed in 1701; the steeple added in 1710 and the tower was connected to the main body of the church in 1759. Robert Clive - more famous as Clive of India- married Margaret Maskelyne here in 1753. The first but equally famous wedding was that of Governor Elihu Yale (who was to become the benefactor of Yale College) to Catherine Himmers in November 1680. The interior of the church contains many fascinating plaques and monuments to early British India evoking past glories and lives full of achievement. It also contains the old colours of the Madras Fusiliers, the first European regiment of the East India Company.

He is believed to have reached South India in AD 52, and spent the last years of his life in a cave on this hill. Tradition states that Thomas was assassinated by an arrow in AD 72, by persons hostile to him. Thus, the hillock acquired the name St. Thomas Mount. Over time Anglo-Indians predominated in this area.

{"name":"Fort St. George","city":"Chennai","country":"India","intro":"  Fort St. George  (formerly known as White Town), is located on the banks of the Bay of Bengal. It was established as the East India Company's fortified foothold in Madras and it was from this small trading post (or 'factory' as it was then known) that British influence spread throughout India. The establishment of Fort St. George marked the birth of the new city that is Madras, in the year 1640. The fort was named after St George who is believed to have preached in the region. The British East India Company, after buying the land from the  Nayak of Vandavasi in 1639 , led the establishment of what was called the  Madrasemen , the permanent settlement of the company. One year later they built the fort as a commanding post in the region. With the increased trade activities of the East India Company the region soon developed into a popular trade and commerce centre. The British enjoyed supremacy in the region until 1746, when the French attacked the fort and captured it. After three years, in 1749 the British regained power by signing a treaty with the French. In the meantime they fortified the base in order to repel the invasion of Hyder Ali and the French.  The fort is believed to be the first establishment of the British in India.  The military architecture is interesting and holds great historical importance. Inside the Fort is the  Fort Museum   [41]  decorated with cannons of Tipu Sultan. There are a lot of interesting artifacts showcased in the museum. Apart from the museum, the southern division of the Archaeological Survey of India is located here. Today, Fort St George is famous for its exotic collection of books in the library and housing the  legislative assembly  in the secretariat building. The fort in its present form looks more like a mansion, rather any fort. Various Government offices function inside this building, including the structure which used to be the residence of Robert Clive called the  Clive House.   St. Mary's Church,  situated in the fort, is one of the oldest surviving churches built by the British in India.  The tallest flag pole  in the country can be seen here, its height is 150 feet. The pole is now made of metal but was originally made entirely of teak wood. Sa-Th 10:00-17:00. Fort Museum: Children <15 yr free, Indian Adults \u20b95, Foreign Adults: \u20b9100"}

A living example of human adaptation to exceptionally unusual natural surroundings, Kandovan village is located 50 km to the south of Tabriz, Osku, on the northern slopes of a valley at the foothills of Mount Sahand. A river originating from the Sahand peaks passes through the valley. There are a number of natural springs to the north of the river, the water from which has traditionally been used for the treatment of kidney stones, according to the locals. The physical structure of the village looks like images from fairy tales. Natural cones, scattered over a vast area, serve as human dwellings on rock formations which themselves seem to have been the work certain sculptors. The road from Tabriz goes through this natural artwork. On getting nearer to the dwellings, the visitor finds out that large families are living inside two or three of these hollow interconnected cones with features such as openings on their surface playing the role of actual windows. The lowest cones are used as stables and those on top as the living quarters."}

In another lifetime, the building was one of the city's best-known sights for an entirely different reason; designed by Czech architect Jan Letzel in 1915, the Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall (and its fanciful green dome) had a bold European style in a grimy, crowded city with few modern flourishes. Because the explosion took place almost directly above the building, the walls remained largely intact, even as the dome shattered and the people inside were killed by the heat of the blast. Initially, as the city rebuilt, it was left alone simply because it was more difficult to demolish than other remains in the area; gradually, the A-Bomb Dome became the symbol it is today. The \"Hiroshima Peace Memorial\" was declared a  UNESCO World Heritage site  in 1996 amid some controversy \u2014 the  United States  and  China  both voted against the nomination for reasons related to the war. Today, the benches around the Dome are a favorite spot for Hiroshima natives to read, eat lunch, or simply relax."}

{"name":"Hamath Tiberias National Park","city":"Tiberias","country":"Israel","intro":"Hamath Tiberias National Park   [8]  - Israel's spa craze actually has a 2000-year-old history which started at the hot springs of Hammat Tiberias when, during Roman times, they were the focus, if not raison d'\u00eatre, of a community of 40,000 fervent bathers. Check out the history of the site at the Hammat Tiberias National Park, which features a small museum in what was originally part of a Turkish bathhouse. The main highlight is a synagogue dating from the 3rd to 5th centuries AD, which has a beautiful zodiac mosaic floor. Much has been made of the mosaic's curious mix of Jewish and pagan symbols, but somehow this seems quite apt in Tiberias, a town that, historically, seems to have been able to reconcile the spiritual with the more earthly. The fame of Hammat Tiberias was such that in AD 110 the Emperor Trajan had a coin struck dedicated to the springs - with the image of Hygeia, the goddess of health, shown sitting on a rock, enjoying the water. The springs were also mentioned by Al-Idris, an Arab writer who lived during the Crusades, and were recommended by the Jewish sage Rambam to his patients."}

Local lore has it that there was an underground tunnel from the castle to the temple, to allow the Maeda lords an escape route in case of attack.

{"name":"Downtown","city":"Montego Bay","country":"Jamaica","intro":" Busy, noisy, intimidating, but refreshingly real. This is not quite what people think of as a tourist attraction. However, this is the best place to go and experience the \"real\" Jamaica. Amidst the crumbling buildings and incessant traffic, Jamaicans go about their daily lives only 1km but a world away from the glitzy resorts on the hip-strip. Here, sidewalks are almost non-existent, hawkers sell their wares next to garbage-piles and getting around is like playing an advanced level of Frogger. Nevertheless, this is the place to go and eat at a real local eatery, or buy some more authentic souvenirs. What's more, there is some seriously interesting architecture in and around the central square. Don't be too intimidated, here, people are generally more likely to be genuinely interested in you (and why you're walking around the city center) rather than try and hustle you for money. Still, it's probably best to avoid here after dark, leave unessentials behind, and to dress down...wearing shorts, sunglasses, sandals, and a tank-top will immediately scream \"Lost Tourist!\". Wear pants, shoes, and a button-shirt, and people may even ask what kind of work you do in Jamaica (seriously!), or (perhaps tongue-in-cheek)if you are Jamaican. Stick around for more than a half hour, and the intimidation wears off and you feel at one with the crowd. The most important thing to gain here is a little perspective. Come face-to-face with the harsh realities of Jamaican life, and maybe you'll have a little more respect for Jamaicans, and a little more understanding for the hustlers or the taxi drivers who keep your $20JMD change."}

Eventually, it became the capital of the Mongol White Horde and, after that, a military fortress under Timur.

{"name":"Hungarian crown jewels","city":"Budapest","country":"Hungary","intro":"  Parliament  ( Orsz\u00e1gh\u00e1z ),  Kossuth Lajos t\u00e9r ,  [1] .  The Hungarian National Parliament building is the largest in Europe, designed by architect Imre Steindl for the 1896 millennial celebrations, and built 1880-1902. It is based on England's Parliament building, and supposedly is one meter wider and longer than that august building, just a little bit of architectural conceit. The building is so immense, the weak alluvial soil along the Danube had to be reinforced with a 7-foot-deep concrete foundation. Not surprising, as the building is 300 yards long and 140 yards wide, with 691 rooms and 12.5 miles of corridors. The lacy white Gothic froth covering the building is actually educational: 88 statues representing Hungarian rulers, princes and military commanders. These statues are small and cannot be readily distinguished from the ground, but they are there.  \u00a0 edit  Under the Parliament's cupola the  Hungarian crown jewels  are exhibited. After World War II, the medieval crown (last used in 1916) was taken out of the country by escaping Hungarian fascists, ending up in the United States. President Carter returned the crown to the Hungarian state in 1978, accompanied by a large American delegation. It was exhibited in the National Museum until 2000 when it was moved to its present location.\u00a0:The only way inside the building is with an organized tour. The tour lasts about 30 minutes. Tours only run on specific times during the day, and you have to get your ticket in advance for a timed slot. The House of Parliament's Visitor Center is directly north of the Parliament building itself and is an underground office reached by stairs. Come back at the specified time on your ticket, and a guide will appear (not in a uniform). Then you can go through security screening before starting. There is a bar\/cafe just inside the main doors which is open to the public during the tour times. Tickets can be purchased in advance online (official tickets sold through Jegymester).  [58] . You can also wait in line and purchase tickets for the guided tour inside the Visitor Center. Multiple guided tours in English, Spanish, German, Italian, Hungarian, Russian, Hebrew, and French are held throughout the day. Visits to the House of Parliament are restricted during weeks in which the National Assembly holds its plenary sittings."}

{"name":"Royal Palace","city":"Budapest","country":"Hungary","intro":" The  Royal Palace  ( Kir\u00e1lyi palota ). The most popular attraction on the hill. Entrance to the area is free, while some museums and attractions have paid admission. Can be reached on foot (sloped paths and\/or a long series of steps), by tourist funicular, or by public transit bus. On foot, walk to the base of the castle on the Buda side and look for the white stairs next to the palace garden park. In the park there is also a small elevator and then a small escalator that will get you part way up. By funicular, cross the chain bridge and then proceed to the base of the station. Tickets cost 1100 HUF for adults for a short ride, and the view is not particularly impressive, so this is a better option for those with limited mobility than those looking for a fun experience. By public transit bus, take bus number 16. The first known buildings here where the Royal Palace stands today, were built by Charles Robert\u2019s eldest son, Stephan Duke of Anjou (1308-1342). It was later remodeled, but the reign of King Matthias brought about the golden age of Buda (1458-1490). Legend has it that when a Turkish ambassador came to Buda, he saw all the wealth and grandeur, forgot his greeting speech and all he could say was \u201eThe emperor sends his respects.\u201d After several remodelings, the unique building we see today is the recreation of Alajos Hauszmann and Mikl\u00f3s Ybl\u2019s1896 millennial designs.

{"name":"Fisherman's Bastion","city":"Budapest","country":"Hungary","intro":" The  Fisherman's Bastion  and lookout terrace ( Hal\u00e1szb\u00e1stya ). For impressive views across the Danube to Pest. This neo-Gothic construction was built in 1905 by the architect Frigyes Schulek. It is composed by seven towers that are symbolizing the seven magyar clans\u2019 leaders that came in the Carpathian Basin at the end of the IX century. It was built between 1890-1905, and is named after both the medieval fishmarket once nearby and the Guild of Fishermen who defended this section of the wall during past wars.  The story is that different trades were responsible for defending different parts of the castle walls and that this section of the defenses was raised by the fishermen\u2019s guild. In fact, the structure is a late 19th century fantasy built to add class to the area. That this is an invention does not detract at all from the attractiveness of the structure, nor from the impressive views of the river and Pest on the opposite side. The mounted statue between the bastion and the church is King Stephan (Istvan in Hungarian) the first king of Hungary (crowned about 1000.) He was declared a saint for his efforts in bringing Christianity to Hungary. He carries the apostolic cross with two crossbars \u2013 a symbol granted him by the Pope. In tourist season there is an admission charge of about $1 to climb on the bastion. In the daytime around the year, the bastion is the place most overcrowded by tourists in the Castle Hill, mainly brought in here by buses. The  sculpture of a Turul bird  just outside the cable car station is not, as you might think, an eagle, but the mythical turul bird (which is believed to be a kind of falcon). This bird is a part of the story of how the Magyars settled the Hungarian homeland. This bird appeared in a dream to the wife of the Magyar leader \u00dcgyek and told her that she would be the founding mother of a new nation."}

The structure has three distinct wings, one Gothic, one Romanesque and one Baroque, making it quite a bizarre sight when seen from a distance. But sneak up closer and its magic will be revealed: thanks to the moat, the trees and the carefully laid footpaths, you can usually only see one section at a time. The attention to detail (all copied from real sites around the country) has been painstaking, so it's like seeing three extraordinarily pretty castles rolled into one.  The structure was originally supposed to be only a temporary one, but Budapest's people liked it so much that it was rebuilt to last.  Located on an island in the middle of the park's lake. "}

The popular Hungarian king, M\u00e1ty\u00e1s, held both of his weddings here, and so it is known as the Matthias Church. Today an eclectic mix of styles, the church was started in the thirteenth century. The main apse, which ends in a seven-sided polygon, is in French style and is the earliest extant section. The central section was built about 100 years later. During the Turkish occupation of Budapest, all the furnishings were removed and the painted walls whitewashed to cover art unacceptable to the Islamic eye. Once returned to the Catholic community, it was Baroquified (i.e. covered with Baroque ornamentation that obscured the original style like many other Central European churches were), and the rose window was bricked up. In the last century, between 1873 and 1896, Frigyes Schulek began a major renovation and restoration of the Matthias Church. The  interior  is sumptuously decorated in a style which is on the one hand art deco and yet evokes the medieval predecessors of this structure. As you enter the church turn to the right and proceed down the right hand aisle to the front of the church. For a small fee you can visit the underground treasury which includes a replica of the Crown of St. Stephen -- the real crown (a 12th century object even though Stephen was a 10th century king) is on display in the parliament building. Also take a look at the opulent chapel at the rear of the church (around the corner to the left of the entrance. Be aware that this is a functioning church and you may find that at times it is closed to visitors for church activities or concerts. To the left of the neighboring Hilton Hotel is what looks like the  wall of a medieval church  with a monument set into it. In fact it is a copy of a monument located in Belsen, Germany (near Dresden). The copy was erected by the ilton Company. It portrays King M\u00e1ty\u00e1s (15th century), the most beloved of Hungarian Kings. In front of the Matthias Church is a  tall column decorated with many statues  \u2013 this is a \u201cplague monument\u201d erected by thankful survivors."}

It is based on England's Parliament building, and supposedly is one meter wider and longer than that august building, just a little bit of architectural conceit. The building is so immense, the weak alluvial soil along the Danube had to be reinforced with a 7-foot-deep concrete foundation. Not surprising, as the building is 300 yards long and 140 yards wide, with 691 rooms and 12.5 miles of corridors. The lacy white Gothic froth covering the building is actually educational: 88 statues representing Hungarian rulers, princes and military commanders.

The castle of Patras was built in the second half of the 6th century A.D. on the ruins of the ancient Acropolis. In A.D. 805 the inhabitants of the city were besieged in the castle by the Slavs and Saracens and their victory, considered a miracle of the city's patron Saint Andrew, was important for repelling the barbarian invasions in Peloponnese. In the following centuries the castle, which remained continuously in use until the Second World War for the defense of the city, as well as an administrative and military centre, was captured by the Franks, Venetians, Palaiologoi and Turks. The castle consists of a triangular outer enclosure reinforced with towers and bastions, which was originally protected by a deep moat and an inner enclosure rising on the NE angle and protected by a moat as well. The building phases distinguishable today on the castle provide evidence for the works carried out by each of its conquerors as repairs and provisions according to the development of military science. The original construction is visible today mainly along the north wall, but remains of it exist on all three sides of the curtain indicating that the original medieval fortification had more or less the same perimeter. To reach the castle one can either travel up the vast staircase or take the short drive to the top. Once reaching the historic site, visitors have the ability to sit and enjoy the view over refreshments."}

{"name":"Acropolis,","city":"Athens","country":"Greece","intro":"The  Acropolis,  a  Unesco World Heritage Site,   [51]   was the ancient fortified town of Athens, dating back to the Late Bronze Age, and the site of the best buildings of the Greek Classical age: the Parthenon, the Erectheion, the Temple of Athena Nike. Acropolis dominates the Athenian sky and symbolizes the foundation of modern culture and civilization. As the most famous landmark of entire Greece, Acropolis is the eternal symbol of democracy, education and inspiration. If you attend a university in the European Union, bring your ID and you can enter for free. The normal entrance price to the Acropolis and its slopes, including the Parthenon and the Theatre of Dionysus, is 20 euros, or 10 reduced (including non-EU students, as of May 2016--seems to be a recent price hike as much tourist literature provided in local hotels still has the old, much lower prices listed).  A 30 euro ticket (15 reduced) also gives you entry to the Kerameikos, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Roman Agora, Ancient Agora, and Hadrian's Library, as well as Aristotle's Lyceum which is a little further away next to the Byzantine and Christian Museum. Also be aware that although the Acropolis is open until 20:00 in the summer, the other sites have earlier closing times; the 30 euro ticket is good for 5 days, but does not allow reentry to a previously visited site since the stub for each site is torn off of the large ticket when you enter; not all of the other sites offer the combined ticket, so if you plan to go to all of them, you should go to the Acropolis first. If possible, get to the Acropolis early to avoid heavy crowds, and summer heat when relevant. There are two entrances, the lesser-used one starting near the new Acropolis Museum and allowing you to climb up through the Theatre of Dionysus, but this is a little bit more physically taxing as the climb can get steep.

In so doing, the firm's directors Eduard Ichon and Johannes Wiegand, who in 1910 had opened the Schauspielhaus am Neustadtwall, widened competition with the municipal theatre, Stadttheater am Wall (now destroyed). Adapting their prices and presentations to suit all segments of the community, they were particularly successful in attracting audiences in the years following the First World War. On October 1, 1941 the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, personally visited the Theater and attended a showing of Die Valkyrie with his lover Eva Braun. However it was after the municipal theatre had suffered serious war damage during World War II, that it was decided the Schauspielhaus am Ostertor should be rebuilt as a fully-fledged three-genre establishment extending the seating from 804 to 1,111 while significantly altering the facade designed by August Abbehusen and Otto Blendermann in 1913. In keeping with the practices of the 1950s, the architects Werner Commichau and Hans Stormraising raised the height of the colonnade and eliminated the high hipped roof, successfully simplifying the facade and giving it a more austere appearance"}

In the middle ages this was the site of Hungary's most important church and had it not been for the Turks blowing it up, it would be to Hungary what Westminster Abbey is to England. The church was begun in 1016 under Hungary's first Christian king, Szent Istv\u00e1n. At the time, Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r was the capital of the kingdom, and this church was the site of numerous coronations. In addition, from 1038 to 1543 fifteen Hungarian kings were put to eternal rest here (starting with Szent Istv\u00e1n himself and ending with Szapolyai J\u00e1nos). As already mentioned, the church was destroyed by the Turks in 1601 and in 1800 the remains were used to build the  Bishops Palace  on nearby V\u00e1rosh\u00e1z square. Today all that remains of the once great basilica are stone walls outlining its form. The big draw, however, is to visit the mausoleum containing Szent Istv\u00e1n's sarchaphogus. This was discovered in 1803 during the building of the Bishop's Palace. The cherubic forms on the outside and royal relics contained within clearly identified this as the tomb of Szent Istv\u00e1n. The sarchaphogus originally was taken to the National Museum in Budapest, but was brought back to Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in 1936, and since then has remained in the attractive mausoleum at the entrance of the garden.

There is a market day on the town square and it is one of the most wonderful things about this town. Wednesday and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. throughout the summer season and only on Saturdays until noon the rest of the year. The market is crowded with people, buying and talking, watching and contemplating... listening to the live music and drinking beer.The requirement for being a vendor here is, you have to have made the wares yourself. There are fresh organic vegetables, battered fried fish, sausages and bitters, photo-cards, jewellery, artworks and crafts, hats sweaters and socks, even leather shoes; there is something for everyone here.  A big hit with the kids is the horse and buggy ride around the town, picking up and dropping people off on the market. The colourful life of the market on its own is worth the visit. The unique red church from the 1300s is also worth seeing, it is one of the oldest on the island and one of the prettiest too, as it watches over Baltic. Svaneke has two harbours, a larger one and a smaller one for the locals, filled with colourful boats and a nearby seafood smokehouse (with indoor and outdoor dining). But perhaps what this town is most well known for... is its beer. The islands only brewery Svaneke Bryghus has become quite well known all over Denmark.

With a height of 35 metres, it has dominated the Upper Square ( Horn\u00ed n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed ) ever since and was added to the UNESCO list of World Cultural Heritage in the year 2000. The column features sculptures of the Holy Trinity (predictably), the assumption of the Virgin Mary, all twelve apostles, three virtues and the most important saints of the Baroque period.

It is one of the traditional rendezvous points in the city. \n The renaissance  Olomouc Town Hall  occupies the centre of the main square ( Horn\u00ed n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed ).

Czechoslovakia was under Communist rule by then and the clock reflects the values of the day, the saints and angels being replaced by scientists, sportspeople and labourers. At 12 noon the clock has a presentation that is unique to its structure and construction.  There is one other astronomical clock in the Czech lands (in the other ancient capital, Prague), but as a surviving example of Socialist-Realism, the Olomouc Astronomical clock is unique world-wide. It is another popular rendezvous point in the city. \n The baroque  Caesar's Fountain  is the largest fountain in Olomouc. It depicts the legendary founder of the city, Gaius Julius Caesar, riding a horse. It is one of the six great baroque Roman-themed fountains you can find in the city. \n The baroque  Hercules' Fountain  depicts Hercules fighting Hydra.

You can walk through the complex for free, or you can pay for a visit to the Castle Museum, the observation gallery of the Chateaux Tower, two different guided tours of the Chateau interiors or the Baroque Castle Theatre. Plan at least two hours for your visit, and buy supplies for a picnic lunch in the Chateau Garden at the grocery across the ulice from the entrance on Latr\u00e1n.  The best approach to the complex is from Latr\u00e1n. Walk through the red iron gates to the first courtyard that houses the Unios Tourist Information center, public washrooms, a souvenir shop, Doxa Galerie, and in the summer months, a tropically inspired mixed drink stand serving up mojitos, caipirinhas, and daquiris. As you approach the Little Castle, you cross the Bear Moat, where the famous Krumlov bears gambol about lazily. Put a few coins in the slot to help keep them fat and happy.  The second courtyard features the entrance to the Castle Museum and the Chateau Tower (80 Kc and 50 Kc respectively, 130 Kc combined). After slogging up the vertiginous staircase, you are treated to a 360-degree view of the town. The second courtyard also hosts a small fountain, and the main ticket office where you can book scheduled tours of the interior to the Chateau and the one-of-a-kind Baroque Castle Theatre (consider buying the tickets in advance if you would like to attend the tours as the entrance to the tours is quite distant from the ticket office and you may find it tiring to walk back all the way once you reach there). The restaurant Maselnice, across from the ticket office, is a good place to stop for refreshment.  Tours of the Chateau interior begin in the third courtyard, where you will find another souvenir store and the entrance to the Wenceslaus Cellars (60 Kc), which now houses modern ceramic art pieces. Pla\u0161tovy Most, or the \u201cCloaked Bridge\u201d is covered by a walkway that leads from the Chateau to the Baroque Theatre, and affords another sweeping view of the town. Continue to walk uphill and you will find the entrance to the monumental chateau gardens. A newly restored fountain, maze of hedgerows, a revolving theatre   and a Medieval-style restaurant, Marketa beckon. At the far end of the chateau gardens, you\u2019ll find a lush duck pond, situated in a stand of moody, gnarled trees. This is the perfect picnic spot."}

The lighthouse continued to function until the time of the Arab conquest, then several disasters occurred and the shape of lighthouse was changed to some extent, but it still continued to function. During the 11thcentury an earthquake destroyed the top of the lighthouse and the bottom was used as a watchtower. A small Mosque was built on the top.

A major multinational UNESCO team relocated Philae, and a number of other temples that now dot the shores of Lake Nasser. You can see the submerged original island a short distance away, punctuated by the steel columns used in the moving process.  Note the re-use of the temple as a Christian church, with crosses carved into the older hieroglyph reliefs, and images of the Egyptian gods carefully defaced. There are grafitti dating from the 1800s.  There is a cheesy Sound and Light show at night, with English actor voices.  Scammers: Watch out for the guards who will do all in their power to get in your photos, (to get a tip), point out hieroglyphs that you can quite clearly see yourself (to get a tip), or invite you to 'pray' (against the rules), also for some baksheesh(tip)! Driver from town 40LE to 100LE with wait and return. 5LE for parking the car.

Locals are charged 10LE for the boat ride to the island, but the boatmen will attempt to charge you 50LE per person at least. A reasonable price should be 40-50LE per person, with wait and return included. If you are only one person, you may have to pay 100LE (2016).  The ticket booth is located at the entrance to the pier, which means you will have to buy your non-refundable ticket for the temple and have it torn by the ticket attendant *before* you can begin haggling over the price of the boat ride. It may help to wait for other travellers to show up so you can split the boat fee (if your taxi driver permits). Bargain hard. The temple is beautiful and worth seeing. "}

{"name":"Parliament Hill","city":"Ottawa","country":"Canada","intro":" The primary attraction for most visitors is  Parliament Hill   [104] . Parliament Hill is in the middle of downtown Ottawa, overlooking the Ottawa River. Not only is the building a fine example of the Gothic revival style, it makes an excellent starting point to visit all other points of interest in the area. Tours of the building are available daily with multiple tours (in both official languages) available at staggered times throughout the day. If you have a group of greater than 10 people, you must make a reservation in advance by calling the reservations office at +1 613 996-0896. The Centre Block tour is the most popular as it includes inside views of the House of Commons, the Senate, and the newly renovated Library of Parliament. Same-day tickets are free and available on a first-come-first-served basis from 9:00 AM.  Pick up your ticket as early as possible to have the best chance of securing a start time that works for you. Tours last from 20 to 60 minutes depending on building activity. From July 2 to Labour Day (early September), tours of the East Block are also available; tour guides take you through the restored offices of some of the Fathers of Confederation (Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir George-Etienne Cartier, Governor General Lord Dufferin and the original Privy Council Office) explaining the beginnings of the Dominion of Canada while historical characters let you in on the daily lives of Canada's past politicians. Tours last about an hour and free same-day tickets can be picked up at the Info-tent on the Hill by West Block. If there are no more tickets available, or you have to wait for your time, a fine self-guided walking tour around the grounds of Parliament Hill will keep you busy. Free booklets are available at the visitors' centre. One of the nicer, unexpected views, looking from the bottom up, can be accessed at the back of the Parliament Buildings -- that vantage point also provides a river view of the Canadian Museum of History, across the river in downtown Gatineau (a sector that was formerly the city of Hull). The walk down from the southwest corner of the Centre Block allows visitors to visit the Hill cats, a group of feral animals housed there by volunteers. Behind the Parliament Buildings at sunset is a sight to remember. You can walk by the Rideau Canal locks (at the east corner) and visit the Bytown Museum at the level of the canal. The locks divide Parliament Hill from the Fairmont Chateau Laurier, a former railway hotel. This hotel once housed the offices of CBC Radio in Ottawa as well as the studio of well-known portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh. Several framed Karsh photographs are hung in the hotel lounge. His (and his wife's) home suite is now available for guests and displays a small sampling of framed prints on the walls. The Changing of the Guard takes place daily on the lawns of Parliament at 9:00am. The Governor General's guards can also be seen at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider and at Rideau Hall."}

More than 14,000 people were tortured here before being killed here or at the Killing Fields; only 8 prisoners survived. (which is a misconception, as you will learn in the museum) The museum is easily accessible and a must-see for everyone interested in Cambodia's horrific recent past. The infamous \"skull map\" has been dismantled, although there are still skulls stacked in cabinets, implements of torture and disturbing photographs of people dying. For an introduction and further reading, try David Chandler's \"Voices from S-21\" (ISBN 0520222474). Documentary movie \"S-21\" can be purchased throughout Phnom Penh for USD1.50-2. Some of the entrance fee will go into the pocket of the museum's director, who is the son a government minister. And a warning to those who patronise the souvenir shop: don't get conned into buying a 'vintage' Rolex, Patek Philippe, Omega watch as, despite the convincing claims of the owner that they are husbands; they are fakes. Instead, opposite the museum (No 28, Street 330) is a little shop called CHA that provides inexpensive handmade goods that are made by women disabled from polio and land mines. If you ask, you will also be able to tour the shop, meeting the female workers and seeing where they study English. Admission fee is USD 3 and free for student with an ID-card (April 2015). "}

{"name":"The Killing Fields of Choeung Ek","city":"Phnom Penh","country":"Cambodia","intro":"A former Chinese cemetery, this is where the Khmer Rouge killed many thousands of their victims during their four-year reign of terror. Today the site is marked by a Buddhist stupa packed full with over 8,000 human skulls - the sides are made of glass so the visitors can see them up close. There are also pits in the area where mass graves were unearthed, with ominous scraps of clothing still to be found here and there. It is a serene yet somber place. Regularly throughout the day, a small museum screens a documentary with gruesome video images of human remains that were unearthed when the mass graves were found in 1979. Recommended to visit after learning more about the Khmer Rouge terror at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, however, like the Genocide Museum, this place is not for the squeamish. As millions were killed during the traumatic genocidal regime of Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge, as a sign of respect you should wear respectable clothing such as long trousers with sleeved shirts or tops. Flowers and incense can be bought in front of the stupa. In 2005 the memorial site was sold to a private company  . A tuk tuk to the site should cost USD9-11 return (after haggling, of course), including stopping at the Genocide Museum on the way and waiting for you at both places. Admission cost is 3 USD, although the advertised price is USD6, but that includes the (very good) audio tour, with a choice of several languages. If you don't want to do the audio tour, just say so and then you only have to pay 3 USD."}

The boat wood was carved into the oddly foreshortened reclining Buddha installed in a swimming pool like pit behind the imposing, yet despondent looking, seated Buddha in the main hall.
